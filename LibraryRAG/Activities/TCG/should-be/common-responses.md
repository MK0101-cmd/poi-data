## Facilitation Strategies

### Addressing External Expectations

#### For Family Pressure
- **Acknowledge**: "I can see how much your family wants what's best for you"
- **Reframe**: "What would you choose if you only had to answer to yourself?"
- **Validate**: "Your family's love doesn't depend on following their expectations"

#### For Cultural Pressure
- **Explore**: "What parts of this expectation feel right to you?"
- **Challenge**: "What would happen if you didn't follow this cultural norm?"
- **Support**: "How can you honor your culture while being true to yourself?"

#### For Social Pressure
- **Question**: "Whose approval are you seeking and why?"
- **Reframe**: "What would authentic relationships look like?"
- **Encourage**: "True friends will support your authentic self"

### Encouraging Authentic Responses

#### Building Self-Awareness
- **Ask open questions**: "What do you truly value?"
- **Encourage reflection**: "What would your ideal life look like?"
- **Validate exploration**: "It's okay not to have all the answers yet"

#### Fostering Boundaries
- **Model assertiveness**: "I appreciate your input, but I need to decide for myself"
- **Practice communication**: "How can you express your needs respectfully?"
- **Support decisions**: "I trust you to make the right choice for yourself"

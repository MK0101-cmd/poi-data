## Land of Fools Story
Many, many years ago, a man wandered from his country to a place known as the land of the fools. Soon after he got there, he saw a number of people fleeing in terror from a field in which they had been harvesting wheat just moments before.

"There's a monster in that field," they said to him.

But when the man went to take a closer look at the "monster," he saw it was nothing but a watermelon, and he offered to "kill" it for them. After chopping the watermelon off its stalk, the man cut himself a piece and began to eat it.

And the people around him now became more terrified of him than they were of the "monster," and they chased him away with their pitchforks, shouting: "He will kill us next unless we get rid of him."

And so it was -- until some time later, when a second wandering man reached the land of the fools, and came across the same scene of people fleeing in terror from a "monster" in the field. This time, however, instead of offering to help them deal with the "monster," the man agreed with them that it was surely very dangerous, winning their trust by quietly tiptoeing away from it.

The man then spent a long time with the people -- until he was able to teach them, little by little, the basic essentials that would allow them to not only overcome their fear of watermelons but also to cultivate them themselves.

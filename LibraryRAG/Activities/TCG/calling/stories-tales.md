## The Magician's Talent

There once lived a king who loved magic and jugglery, and he would promise rich rewards in gold to anyone who could entertain him. Magicians and jugglers came from all over the kingdom. One day, a magician appeared and assured the king that he would be able to perform a unique trick that would impress the king to no end. The magician then told the king that it would cost him 100 gold coins. "So much gold for just one magic trick?" asked the king. "Your Majesty, I will perform the trick for you 20 times, and I assure you that you will be astounded." The king was impressed and agreed to pay. Out of his pocket the magician then took a small box filled with needles. He walked over to a nearby tree, stuck one of the needles in the trunk, and then walked back until he was standing some 50 yards from his target. "Watch closely, Your Majesty," the magician said, pulling out a second needle from the box and throwing it in the direction of the tree. The needle flew straight as an arrow and precisely through the eye of the needle that the magician had embedded in the trunk. "Your Majesty, look, the second needle is on its way." The second needle flew right through the eye of the one stuck in the tree trunk. And thus the magician continued with 20 needles. "Well done," said the king "You certainly deserve the 100 gold coins. In addition, however, I am hereby ordering that you be given 20 lashes as punishment; a man with such wonderful skills and abilities should not be wasting his talents on nonsense."

## The Lion Cub's Discovery

A new-born lion cub was adopted by a flock of sheep, which raised the young cat as one of their own kind. And while the cub did indeed grow up to become a big young lion, it was totally unaware of being one; after all, it had been surrounded only by sheep all its life. He had no idea of what he looked like; he was, for all intents and purposes, a sheep: He only ate grass; he feared predators; and he even made the same sounds as a sheep and did not know how to roar. One day, an older lion saw the young one roaming around with the flock of sheep and could hardly believe its eyes. The sheep, for their part, spotted the older lion too, and immediately fled, bleating furiously in fear, with the young lion doing the same. With much effort, the older lion managed to catch up to the panicked younger one, which squealed and cried just like a sheep, shaking in fear. The older lion then grabbed the younger one to a nearby waterhole. The young lion was sure it was about to die. But when they got to the waterhole, lo and behold -- a miracle: "My son," the older lion said, "Look into the water." And there, looking back up at them were the faces of two lions. The younger lion stared at the two faces for a short while, suddenly feeling a change from within -- and from the depths of his being came a roar that shook the plains and hills all around. "My work is done," said the older lion. "I have done all I could, you are now on your own. You now know who you really are."

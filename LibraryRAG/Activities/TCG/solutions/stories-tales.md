## The Farmer and His Two Sons

In a land far, far away lived a farmer and his two sons. As young boys, the sons would help their father with the farm work; but when they grew older, they left their small village for the big city. Sadly, the temptations of the city got the better of them, and the two young men veered off the straight and narrow path their father had laid out for them: The older brother turned murderer, while the younger became a thief; and the two soon found themselves behind bars serving jail sentences. 

The years went by, and the father grew old and weak, and was no longer able to plow his fields. He knew that without help right away, he would lose all he had built over the years and would be left destitute and hungry. So, the father sat down and composed a letter to his younger son. In his letter, the father asked his son to approach the prison board and explain the situation, hoping that this would secure the young man's release. 

When the prison board's negative reply soon came, the saddened father, in his desperation, composed a similar letter to his older son. Immediately on receiving his father's letter, the older son responded with one of his own. "Father, don't dare touch the field. All the treasures from my murder victims are hidden there," he wrote, and sent it off. 

Two days later, 100 policemen raided the father's field, turning over every piece of earth. Of course, they found nothing at all. Another two days passed, and the father received a second letter from his older son: "My dear father," he had written. "I hope the policemen did a good job; I did the best I could. With love, your son."

## Key Insights from the Story

### Creative Problem-Solving
The older son used creative thinking to solve his father's problem by reframing the situation. Instead of directly asking for help (which was denied), he created a scenario that would naturally lead to the desired outcome.

### Reframing the Problem
- **Original Problem**: Father needs help plowing the field
- **Reframed Problem**: Police need to search the field for hidden treasures
- **Solution**: Police plow the field while searching, solving the original problem

### Thinking Outside the Box
The solution required thinking beyond conventional approaches and using available resources (the police) in an unconventional way.

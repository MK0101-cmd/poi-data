## The Beautiful Bird

There was once a truly beautiful bird -- strong, free and very brave. Nothing at all frightened it. It would fly wherever it chose to and was very proud of its very colorful and vibrant plumage.

One day, the bird decided to settle down and build a nest for itself. And so, one by one, it began to pluck out its feathers and to use them to build a beautiful nest, one that was comfortable and gave the bird a true sense of security.

And the bird was happy!

But it could no longer fly.

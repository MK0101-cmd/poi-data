# How I Show Up? – Building Blocks

## Objective
In relationships at home and at work, we don’t always show our true feelings.  
Especially in times of uncertainty, we may appear one way on the outside while feeling differently inside.  
This process helps you see how you *really* want to show up to strengthen your relationships.

## Pause
Take a pause from your thoughts and worries.  
Close your eyes and take a couple of deep breaths.

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 Faces cards** (face up) that best describe you in the situation.  
Additionally, choose **3 Reflection cards** (face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. How do I feel on the inside?  
2. How do I show that I feel to the outside?  
3. How do I want to be seen?

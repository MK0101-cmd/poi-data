# I'm Going All The Way – Building Blocks

## Objective
Clarify your life goals and check within yourself what needs to be done to actually implement them.

## Pause
Choose an important goal you hope to achieve.  
The goal can be in any area of life — personal relationships, parenting, work, money, etc.  
Clearly write down your goal.  
Examples:  
- I want to earn at least $15,000 a month.  
- I want to be in a personal relationship.

## Cards / Prompts

Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. What brings me closer to my goal?  
2. What’s preventing/stopping me from achieving my goal?

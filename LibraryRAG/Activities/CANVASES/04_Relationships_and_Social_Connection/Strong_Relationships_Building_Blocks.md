## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (face up or face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:  

1. What do I give in the relationship?  
2. What does my significant other give in the relationship?  
3. What is the energy of our relationship?  

*(When working with your significant other, answer questions 1 & 2 separately, then explore question 3 together.)*

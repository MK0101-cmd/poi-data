- **Best For**: Life transitions, dissatisfaction, seeking change

### **3. What do I want?**

### **4. Finally**

## How to Use Layout Processes

### **Method A: Choose a Defined Process**
1. Choose the issue you want to observe or gain new perspectives about
2. Select the process that suits your interest best
3. Place the Layout cards face up in front of you
4. Choose three Photo cards, face up or face down
5. Place one Photo card next to each Layout card
6. Go over each question separately and observe the card you chose
7. Use the book to expand your perspective about each topic
8. See how they link with your issue
9. When you feel the question is answered, move to the next one
10. Look at your chosen cards together - see how they link together
11. Take a photo of your process for future reference
12. Note your insights and planned actions

### **Method B: Mix & Match**
1. Intuitively create your own process by picking Layout cards face up or face down
2. Choose from 3 to 5 cards
3. Use Blank Layout cards to ask your own questions
4. When working with cards face down, keep the element of surprise
5. Follow the same process as Method A

## Working with Cards

### **Face Up vs Face Down**
- **Face Up**: Lets you observe the process of choosing
- **Face Down**: Enables you to let go of control and adds an element of surprise

### **Facilitation Tips**
- If working with someone, be their guide in their journey
- Be curious about the cards they picked and what they see in them
- Ask open-ended questions about their observations
- Support their process without interpreting for them

# Conflict Series - Building Blocks

The uncomfortable moments of life which take us to the next level.

This series represents the times when we are in disagreement. When there is a clash of ideas and boundaries are being tested. It's inconvenient, but these moments take us to the next step. To avoid conflicts is to avoid life itself. The real conflict is inside of us, the question is do we allow ourselves to put it out?

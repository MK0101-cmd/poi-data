## Story: The Nature of Shame

Shame is the most powerful, master emotion. It's the fear that we're not good enough.

There are three things I know about shame:

Everyone has it.

Everyone is scared to talk about it.

The less we talk about shame, the more control it has over our lives.

*Brene Brown, Daring Greatly*

> "Your shame hides in many places-in anger, blame, denial, workaholism, perfectionism, drinking, and anything else you compulsively engage in to make yourself feel better. But if you could just learn to be vulnerable for one second, and open up to the pain, you would find there's no place left for your shame to hide."

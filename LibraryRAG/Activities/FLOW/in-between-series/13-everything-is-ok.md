## Story: Everything's Fine

In October 2013, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Our topic of the month at Points of YouÂ® was "unexpected" and along those exact same lines, I found myself constantly hearing and saying that very imprecise phrase, everything's okay.

Is everything okay? Everything will be okay! Everything's fine, dear. Things will be fine. I'm okay!!! And during it all, things were as far from fine as they could be. Even being asked if everything's okay was irritating.

However, after the first shock of the illness, I suddenly understood that "everything's okay" is a state of mind that allows me - and other people too, even if for only a second - to feel and believe that things really and truly are alright. This realization made it possible for me to put all those unexpected, nagging feelings and fears aside for a moment. It helped me to feel and believe that everything really is fine!

Thank heavens, everything's fine. As I write this, I am two weeks post surgery and in the process of healing, and it's good to know that everything's fine :) I hope that everything's fine with you too...

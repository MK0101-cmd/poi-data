## Story: Five More Minutes

One time Robert took his five year old daughter Claudia to the park. When they reached the park Claudia started playing on the toy bike while Robert sat on a bench nearby and observed his daughter.

After some time, Robert called his daughter. "Claudia, Shall we go now?". Claudia pleaded, "No, Just five more minutes, Dad. Please?." Robert nodded and Claudia continued to ride her bike to her heart's content.

Fifteen minutes passed, Robert called again. "Come on Claudia, It's time to go now." Claudia again pleaded, "Five more minutes, Dadâ€¦.. just five more minutes." Robert agreed, his eyes were filled with happiness.

After 15 minutes or so, the same thing happened again, Robert called Claudia and she pleaded to be allowed to play for a few more minutes. Again, Robert agreed to let her play.

A woman sitting next to Robert was observing all this and was quite surprised. She said, "You are a patient father, I appreciate how you accommodate your daughter's request again and again with a smiling face. If I were in your shoes, I would have certainly got annoyed." Robert smiled and replied, "Her older brother was killed last year while he was coming back home. I never spent much time with him and now I would give anything to spending just five more minutes with him. I've vowed not to make the same mistake with Claudia. She thinks she has five more minutes to ride her bike. The truth is, I get five more minutes to watch her play."

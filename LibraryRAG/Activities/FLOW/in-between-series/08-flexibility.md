## Story: The Retired Man and the Boys

An elderly retired man was bothered by noisy boys playing outside the window of his small, first-floor apartment. Did he yell at them to go away? No. That wouldn't have been smart. He went outside and said he loved hearing boys play and that he would give them each a quarter to play under his window. The boys were delighted. He paid them a quarter every day for a week.

The second week he came out after they had been playing and explained that because he was very poor, he could only afford a dime for each of them. The boys didn't like the reduction in their wage. Several left, but most of them stayed. At the beginning of the third week, the retired man came out and explained that he was so poor he could afford only a penny for each of them each day. The boys left, saying they wouldn't play near his window for pennies.

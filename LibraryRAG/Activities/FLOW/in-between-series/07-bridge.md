## Story: The Carpenter's Bridge

Once upon a time, two brothers who lived on adjoining farms fell into conflict. Their long collaboration fell apart. It exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence.

One morning there was a knock on the older brother's door.

He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. "Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there?" the man asked. "Yes," said the older brother. "Look across the creek at that farm. That's my neighbor, it's my younger brother. See that pile of lumber curing by the barn? I want you to build me a fence, so I won't need to see his place anymore." The carpenter said, "I think I understand the situation. Show me the nails and the post-hole digger and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you." The carpenter worked hard all that day, measuring, sawing, nailing. At sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge.

The neighbor, his younger brother, was coming across, his hand outstretched. "You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done."

The two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter hoist his toolbox on his shoulder. "No, wait! Stay a few days" said the older brother. "I'd love to stay on," the carpenter said, "but, I have many more bridges to build."

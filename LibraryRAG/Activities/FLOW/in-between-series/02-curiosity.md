## Story: The Guru and the Teacup

A seeker has heard that the wisest guru in all of India lives atop India's highest mountain. So the seeker treks over hill and Delhi until he reaches the fabled mountain. It's incredibly steep, and more than once he slips and falls. By the time he reaches the top he is full of cuts and bruises, but there is the guru, sitting cross legged in front of his cave.

"Oh wise guru," the seeker says, "Tell me what is the meaning of life?"

"Ah yes the secret of life" the guru says scratching his chin. "The secret of life is a teacup."

"A teacup? I came all the way up here to ask you what the secret of life is and you tell me it's a teacup?"

The guru shrugs "So maybe it isn't a teacup."

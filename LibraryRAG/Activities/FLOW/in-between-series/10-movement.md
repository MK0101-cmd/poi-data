## Story: The Hippie Movement

The Hippie Movement began in the 1960s and was very influential on American politics, law and everyday life. This was a time where predominantly the youth started reflecting on social values. A new counterculture was forming and those involved were not afraid of what people thought of them. Their ideas on all things political, social, cultural and every day values were completely different to what Americans had seen before. Hippies focused more on cultural values in life rather than political issues, even though politics played a big part in their, "Make Love, Not War" slogan. They were antiwar and promoted peace and love as an answer to all things. They gained a lot of public attention. The biggest issues society had with them were their public protests, meetings and discussions that would flood the streets. Many hippies dropped out of school and followed their own paths of self-discovery, with the use of drugs, sex and rock n roll which were seen as natural and spiritual. They referred to the regular, American citizens as "squares" - People who follow rules and standards that have been placed upon Everyone, like the average nine to five job and the stresses that come along with it. The hippies were easy to identify because of the way they looked, dressing outside of social norms. For example, male hippies wore very long hair and beards. They lived in communes together and would frequently move out into the woods to become one with nature. The hippie movement laid an image on the 1960s and 1970s on youth and American culture. The movement landed in history textbooks for generations to talk about.

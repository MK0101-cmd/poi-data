## Story: The Stomach Rumble

A group of people used to meet every evening to meditate in one of the monasteries in Kyoto. One evening, one of the participants arrived late; he did not have time to eat his evening meal. During meditation his stomach began to rumble so loudly that it could be heard throughout the room. The following day, before the start of meditation, one of the other participants turned to him and said, "I hope you have eaten this evening. Last night, the noise of your stomach was so loud that it was hard to concentrate." "Yes, I have eaten this evening, and I have also made sure that the crickets will be silent and the moon will not shine. This evening there will be no disturbances."

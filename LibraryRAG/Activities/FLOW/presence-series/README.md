# Presence Series - Building Blocks

The moments of life when we allow ourselves to be.

This series represents the awareness of being in a state of existence. When we are in the rhythm of life but not reacting to it. Feeling with all our senses, being in the now. It's finding the stillness in us when we allow ourselves to be with our mind, body and soul.

## Story: The Two Brothers

Once there were two brothers who inherited their father's land. The brothers divided the land in half and each one farmed his own section. Over time, the older brother married and had six children, while the younger brother never married. One night, the younger brother lay awake. "It's not fair that each of us has half the land to farm," he thought. "My brother has six children to feed and I have none. He should have more grain than I do." So that night the younger brother went to his silo, gathered a large bundle of wheat, and climbed the hill that separated the two farms on his way to his brother's farm. He left the wheat in his brother's silo. Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake. "In old age, my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, while my brother will probably have no one. He should at least sell more grain from the fields now." So that night, he too secretly gathered a large bundle of wheat and left it in his brother's silo. The next morning, each of the brothers was surprised to see the amount of grain in his barn unchanged.

The next night, each brother gathered a large pile of wheat from his barn, loaded it onto a cart, and slowly pulled his haul through the fields and up the hill to his brother's barn. When each of the brothers recognized the form of the other brother and the load he was pulling behind, they realized what had happened. Without a word, they dropped the ropes to their carts and embraced.

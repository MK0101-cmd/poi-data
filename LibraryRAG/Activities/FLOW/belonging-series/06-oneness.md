## Story: Achieving Oneness

Everything in the universe is connected. We are all one. But our daily habits can separate us from oneness. Follow these steps to achieve oneness.

See Your Own Oneness- When you stand in front of a mirror, pause for a moment, and look directly into your eyes. Say silently or aloud AHUM BRAHMASMI (a hum brah mass me), which means I am the Universe or I am the totality. You can say it in English if you prefer. This is your soul reflecting back into itself and reminding itself of its Oneness. Practice this at least once a day or whenever you catch your reflection in a mirror.

Namaste- The Indian blessing Namaste (nam ass tay) is accompanied by bringing the palms together in front of the heart center, when meeting or taking leave of someone. It means, "I recognize the Divinity in you which is also the Divinity in me" or in other words, "We are the same Oneness." If it's not comfortable for you to say it aloud, think it silently every time you meet someone.

## Story: The King's Portrait

There was once a King who had one eye and one leg. He asked all the painters to draw a beautiful portrait of him. But none of them could -- how could they paint him beautifully with his defects, with one eye and one leg.

Eventually one of the painters agreed and drew a classic picture of the King.

It was a fantastic picture that surprised everyone. The painter made a portrait in which the king was sitting on the horse, on the one-leg side, holding his bow and aiming the arrow with his one eye closed…

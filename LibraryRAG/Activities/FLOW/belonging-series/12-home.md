## Story: The Painter's Vision

In the last months of his life, the painter Serge Valene came up with the idea of creating a single picture that would encompass his entire experience: it would contain everything ever registered in his memory, all the feelings he had ever had, all his dreams, his communication, all the tiny details making up his life.

The picture would show the Parisian apartment building in which he had lived for more than 55 years. The facade of the building would be removed and it would be possible to see a cross-section of all the rooms at the front of the building, the elevator shaft, the stairs, the front doors to the apartments. And like in those dollhouses in which everything is copied in miniature, the carpets, the etchings, the wall clocks, the samovars - in each room it would be possible to find the people who had lived there in the past and the people still living there, and all the details of their lives, their cats, their faces, their story...

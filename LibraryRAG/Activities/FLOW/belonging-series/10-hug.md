## Story: The Big Bear Hug

Once upon a time there was a bear, overflowing with love and happiness, who only wanted to spread the love. Whenever he came across another living being as he wandered through the forest, he would hug it.

The bear was so invested in his desire to spread love that he didn't really see or take any interest in the wishes of the other creature that he hugged, whether it was small or large, whether it liked being hugged or not. He simply hugged. More than anything else, the bear loved to hug trees. Trees that might be bowed down by a bear hug, as well as those that could withstand it.

One day, the bear saw a man walking through the forest carrying an axe. The man looked long and hard at a splendid old tree, and then began to chop it down. For the first time in his life, the bear did not want to hug; instead he felt the need to attack.

At the last second the bear stopped himself. He decided that it was not in his nature to attack, and so he chose to do the best thing he knew how - to hug. The man was so startled that he ran for his life, and then the bear was free to do what he loved the most - he hugged the tree.

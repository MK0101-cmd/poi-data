# FLOW Decomposition Process

This folder contains all documentation related to the decomposition process of the FLOW book into the organized folder structure. These files document the methodology, planning, execution, and validation of the content extraction and organization process.

## Files in This Folder

### **Planning & Methodology**
- **[DECOMPOSITION-PLAN.md](DECOMPOSITION-PLAN.md)** - Original plan for decomposing the FLOW book
- **[TOPIC-EXTRACTION-PLAN.md](TOPIC-EXTRACTION-PLAN.md)** - Detailed plan for extracting individual topics

### **Content Extraction**
- **[COMPLETE-CONTENT-EXTRACTION.md](COMPLETE-CONTENT-EXTRACTION.md)** - Overview of the complete extraction process
- **[EXTRACTED-CONTENT.md](EXTRACTED-CONTENT.md)** - Documentation of extracted content
- **[EXTRACTION-COMPLETE.md](EXTRACTION-COMPLETE.md)** - Completion status and summary

### **Database & Organization**
- **[CONTENT-EXTRACTION-DATABASE.md](CONTENT-EXTRACTION-DATABASE.md)** - Database structure for organizing extracted content

### **Validation & Quality Assurance**
- **[VALIDATION-REPORT.md](VALIDATION-REPORT.md)** - Quality validation and verification report

## Purpose

These files serve as:
- **Historical Documentation** - Record of how the FLOW book was transformed into the organized folder structure
- **Methodology Reference** - Guide for similar decomposition projects
- **Quality Assurance** - Validation that the extraction process was complete and accurate
- **Process Transparency** - Clear documentation of the steps taken to create the final structure

## Usage

These files are primarily for:
- **Project Documentation** - Understanding how the FLOW structure was created
- **Methodology Reference** - Applying similar processes to other content
- **Quality Verification** - Ensuring completeness and accuracy of the extraction
- **Future Maintenance** - Reference for updates and modifications

## Integration with Main FLOW Structure

The decomposition process resulted in the main FLOW folder structure with:
- 65 topic files across 5 series
- 66 photo cards
- 4 layout processes
- 7 implementation guides
- Comprehensive documentation and cross-referencing

The main FLOW folder contains the final, organized, and user-ready content, while this decomposition folder contains the process documentation that led to that structure.

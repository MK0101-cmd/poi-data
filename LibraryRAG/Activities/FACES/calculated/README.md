# CALCULATED SERIES - Building Block Overview

## Overview
The Calculated Series helps participants explore the places where we are accurate with ourselves. These are the parts which love order and logic. From them comes the ability to be analytical, cool and stable even under pressure; to keep morals and ethics, to take responsibility. Sometimes with difficulty, to color outside the lines. The mission is above all.

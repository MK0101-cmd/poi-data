# LOST SERIES - Building Block Overview

## Overview
The Lost Series helps participants explore the places where we lose our way. These are the stuck parts. Those dark places we have no idea how to get out of. These are the moments in which we feel small. These are vulnerable, victim-like, voiceless parts which cause us to lose faith quickly and give up - mainly on ourselves.

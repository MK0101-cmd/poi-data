# First Encounter - Working with FACES

## Introduction

FACES is based on the exact same working method as The Coaching Game and Punctum. Photo cards, word cards, an inspirational book and process maps. However, the work with FACES is entirely different than with the two other games â€“ which are based on the elements of Phototherapy and metaphors.

FACES is obviously a Phototherapeutic tool as well, but the observation of images of faces, of facial features, of expressions, leaves us staring directly, with no mediators or metaphors. We are observing something external, but the processing of it is emotional. With FACES we can look deeply into ourselves, into our meaningful relationships and into people in general.

## Card of the Day Process

For your first encounter with the game, we offer a short process: **Card of the day**.

### Setup
1. Lay the Photo cards and the Reflection cards in front of you - facing up
2. Go over all of them carefully
3. Ask yourself: **How am I feeling today?**

### Selection
Choose one Photo card and one Reflection card which best depict your current mood.

### Observation - Photo Card
Ask yourself:
- Why did you choose this face?
- What does this face express?
- What kind of character is he/she?
- What would you like to say to the character in front of you?
- What is it trying to tell you?
- What do you feel when you look at it?
- Who does this character remind you of?
- Does it look like anyone you know?

### Observation - Reflection Card
Ask yourself:
- Which emotions, feelings, memories does it bring out of me?
- How does the word connect to the image I chose?

### Deepening the Inspiration
1. Open the book on the page number mentioned on the Reflection card
2. Read the various types of content
3. Try to answer the original questions using new points of view

### Photo Card Content Integration
- **Card Reference**: Use [PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md](../PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md) to identify which series your selected Photo Card belongs to
- **Series Connection**: Explore the corresponding building block content (Open-minded, Givers, Takers, Stormy, Calculated, Lost, or Knowing)
- **Cross-Reference**: Consider how your Photo Card might relate to other series for deeper exploration
- **Content Links**: Follow the specific story, quote, and question links provided in the Photo Card index

### Reflection Card Integration
- **Reflection Card Reference**: Use [REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md](../REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md) to identify which series your selected Reflection Card belongs to
- **Page Number Navigation**: Use the page number on your Reflection Card to access specific building block content
- **Thematic Connection**: Connect your Reflection Card theme with your Photo Card emotion
- **Combined Exploration**: Use both cards together for comprehensive self-discovery

## What You Can Explore

- **Family trees**: Observe patterns and relationships in your family
- **Ideal partners**: Define what you're looking for in relationships
- **Recruiting**: Use as an asset in hiring new employees
- **Leadership style**: Observe your way of leading and managing
- **Self-reflection**: Look deeply into yourself through others' faces
- **Relationship dynamics**: Understand how you relate to others

## Enjoy the Journey

FACES is a deep, surprising and fascinating journey inwards. Through the observation of others, we dare to look at ourselves in the most direct manner, and that is what FACES provides - a straight look into our own eyes.

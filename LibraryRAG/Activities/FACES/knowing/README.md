# KNOWING SERIES - Building Block Overview

## Overview
The Knowing Series helps participants explore the places where we know deep inside. The parts of us that just know. Connected, independent, on their path. These parts make us turn into leaders. The places that are open to dealing with the quest itself and the journey - less about others, more about me.

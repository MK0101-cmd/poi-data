# CALCULATED SERIES

The places where we are accurate with ourselves.

These are the parts which love order and logic. From them comes the ability to be analytical, cool and stable even under pressure; to keep morals and ethics, to take responsibility. Sometimes with difficulty, to color outside the lines. The mission is above all.

## Reflections in this Series

### Wise
/ LIFE WISDOM / COMMON SENSE / WITH EXPERIENCE /

**Story:**
Three prisoners were sitting together in prison: two wise men and one fool. In the prison, which was in a basement, it was dark all day long, and the prisoners were served a daily meal through a small hole in the wall.

The wise men managed to find their way and eat even in the darkness, but the fool could not. One of the wise men noticed this and decided to help him out: He found his way to the fool and with much effort, started feeding him, spoon by spoon.

Eventually he lost his patience and yelled at the other wise man: "Sir, why are you not helping me? Can't you see that our friend cannot eat by himself and needs our help?"

"You are investing a great deal of effort into feeding him," answered the second wise man, "but I'm putting my effort into something else: I am searching for a way to widen the hole so that light will enter and so that the fool will manage to eat on his own."

### Balanced
/ HARMONIOUS / ONE AND THE OTHER / STABLE / GROUNDED /

**Story:**
Once upon a time, Alexander the Great arrived at an Antique store, noticed an eye, and asked to purchase it. He asked for its price, and the seller answered that it will cost as much as it weighs in gold. Alexander agreed and asked to buy it. The seller placed the eye on the scale, and Alexander added on the opposite side a few golden coins. To his surprise, the more coins Alexander added, the heavier the eye turned out to be. Alexander was shocked by the weight of the eye glaring at him. It even seemed to him as if the glare of the eye had a spark of victory in it, knowing it cannot be won over by his gold. An old man who was present stepped slowly towards the eye and poured a few grains of sand into the open eye, which shut – and suddenly, the scale shot up tumultuously.

### Reliable
/ PERSON OF THEIR WORD / THE ADULT IN CHARGE / RESPONSIBLE /

**Story:**
In 1986, a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test destroyed Unit 4 of Chernobyl's nuclear power plant, spewing massive amounts of deadly radioactive material into the environment. The death toll was unknown and rumored to be anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand.

While many perished, three clean-up volunteers – Alexi Ananenko, Valeri Bezpoalov and Boris Baronov – willingly met their fate.

During the well-documented disaster, a pool of water used for emergencies in case of a break in the cooling pumps or steam pipes became flooded with a highly radioactive liquid that was in danger of blowing up. These three men suited up in scuba gear and swam into the radioactive waters of the flooded chamber, knowing full well they would die as a result. They opened up a gate valve, which allowed the contaminated water to drain out. Days after reaching the surface all three men succumbed to radiation poisoning and were buried in lead coffins. If not for the bravery of the "Chernobyl Suicide Squad" a thermal explosion would have taken place resulting in unfathomable disaster.

### Mission Oriented
/ EFFICIENT / FOCUSED / HARD-WORKING / DOER / PRAGMATIC /

**Story:**
"I never did anything worth doing entirely by accident… Almost none of my inventions were derived in that manner. They were achieved by having trained myself to be analytical and to endure and tolerate hard work."

Thomas Edison wasn't about working smarter, just working harder. And that doesn't come as much of a surprise to us today, given that one of Edison's most famous quotes is "Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration."

But most people don't realize that that's only half the quote. There's more to the quote than just the most frequently repeated bits. Here's the whole Edison quote:

"Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Accordingly, a 'genius' is often merely a talented person who has done all of his or her homework."

### Accurate
/ PERFECTIONIST / PEDANT / INTO DETAILS /

**Story:**
"Hey Steve – this is Vic," I said. "I'm sorry I didn't answer your call earlier. I was in religious services, so I didn't pick up."

Steve laughed. "Vic, unless the Caller ID said 'GOD', you should never pick up during services."

I laughed nervously. It was unusual for him to call me on Sunday and ask me to call his home. I wondered what was so important? "So Vic, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away. I've already assigned someone from my team to help you, and I hope you can fix this tomorrow," said Steve.

"I've been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I'm not happy with the icon. The second O in Google doesn't have the right yellow gradient. It's just wrong and I'm going to have Greg fix it tomorrow. Is that okay with you?"

The CEO of Apple – the tech visionary who revolutionized personal computers, the way we listen to music and the way we think of mobile devices – was worried about the yellow in the second "O" in Google. Needless to say the problem was fixed, and Gundotra says it taught him a lesson on leadership and "passion and attention to detail".

### Intellectual
/ RATIONAL / SENSIBLE / EDUCATED /

**Story:**
Imagine a group of people living in a cave underneath the ground. They are sitting with their backs facing the opening of the cave, and their limbs are tied in such a way as to prevent them from seeing anything but the inside wall of the cave.

Behind them a fire is burning, and in its light, strange figures passing by cast different shapes on the wall of the cave. Since they have been sitting this way from the moment they were born, they believe that these shadows are all that exists.

Imagine now that one of the cave's residents manages somehow to free himself from his ties. After his eyes will adjust to the light he will start seeing how beautiful things are. And then he will see the sun in the sky, and will understand that it brings life to flowers and animals, just as the light of the fire created the shadows.

The lucky cave resident can now keep celebrating the freedom upon which he stumbled. He tries to convince his friends that the shadows are only blinking shadows of "actual" things. But they don't believe him. Eventually they kill him.

Ah, yes Mr O'Reilly, well it's perfectly simple. When I asked you to build me a wall I was rather hoping that instead of just dumping the bricks in a pile you might have found time to cement them together... you know, one on top of another, in the traditional fashion. [to Melbury, testily] Basil Fawlty: Could you fill it in, please? [to phone] Basil Fawlty: Oh, splendid! Ah, yes, but *when*, Mr O'Reilly? [to Melbury, who is having difficulty with the register] Basil Fawlty: there - there! [to phone] Basil Fawlty: Yes, but when? Yes, yes... ah!... the flu! [to Melbury] Basil Fawlty: *Both* names, please. [to phone] Basil Fawlty: Yes, I should have guessed, Mr. O'Reilly that and the potato famine I suppose... Lord Melbury: I beg your pardon? Basil Fawlty: Would you put *both* your names, please?... [to phone] Basil Fawlty: Well, will you give me a *date*? Lord Melbury: Er... I only use one. Basil Fawlty: [with a withering look] You don't have a first name? Lord Melbury: No, I am *Lord* Melbury, so I simply sign myself "Melbury". [there is a long, long pause] Basil Fawlty: [to phone] Go away. [puts phone down] Basil Fawlty: ... I'm *so* sorry to have kept you waiting, your lordship... I *do* apologize, *please* forgive me. Now, was there something, is there something, anything, I can do for you? Anything at all?

## Generous
**The Airport Cookie Story**
A woman was waiting for her flight in the boarding area. As she would need to wait many hours, she bought a book to read, a packet of cookies and a suitcase. She sat down in an armchair in the VIP room of the airport to spend the time reading. Next to the armchair where the packet of cookies lay, a man sat down in the next seat, opened his magazine and started reading. When she took out the first cookie, the man took one too. She was irritated but said nothing. She just thought: "What a nerve! If I was in the mood I would punch him for daring!" For each cookie she took, the man took one too. This was infuriating her but she didn't want to cause a scene. When only one cookie remained, she thought: "ah... what will this abusive man do now?" Then the man, taking the last cookie, divided it into half, giving her one half. Ah! That was too much! She was much too angry now! In a huff, she took her book, her things and stormed to the boarding place. When she got on the plane and sat down in her seat, she looked into her purse to take her eyeglasses, and, to her surprise, her packet of cookies was there, untouched, unopened! She felt so ashamed!! She realized that she was wrong... she had forgotten that her cookies were kept in her purse. The man had divided his cookies with her without feeling angered or bitter... while she had been very angry, thinking that she was dividing her cookies with him. And now there was no chance to explain herself... nor to apologize.

## Affectionate
**Amma's Embrace**
Amma has embraced more than 38 million people throughout the world for over 30 years. Her embrace is known as a "mother's love" and many people who have received it say they have felt a great sense of peace and unconditional love. Amma says: "I don't see if it is a man or a woman. I don't see anyone different from my own self. A continuous stream of love flows from me to all of creation. This is my inmost nature. Just as the sun gives its light and heat to all, I give my love to all. This is my nature."

## Gentle
**The Hedgehog's Dilemma**
A number of porcupines huddled together for warmth on a cold day in winter; but, as they began to prick one another with their quills, they were obliged to disperse. However the cold drove them together again, when just the same thing happened. At last, after many turns of huddling and dispersing, they discovered that they would be best off by remaining at a little distance from one another. In the same way the need of society drives the human porcupines together, only to be mutually repelled by the many prickly and disagreeable qualities of their nature. The moderate distance which they at last discover to be the only tolerable condition of intercourse, is the code of politeness and fine manners; and whoever transgresses it is roughly told—in the English phrase—to keep his distance. By this arrangement the mutual need of warmth is only very moderately satisfied; but then people do not get pricked. A man who has some heat in himself prefers to remain outside, where he will neither prick other people nor get pricked himself.

## Caregiver
**The Monk and the Scorpion**
A monk was walking along a path when he saw a scorpion drowning in a stream. He reached down to save it, but the scorpion stung him. The monk pulled his hand back, but then reached down again to save the scorpion. A passerby saw this and asked, "Why do you keep trying to save the scorpion when it keeps stinging you?" The monk replied, "The scorpion stings because that is its nature. I save because that is my nature."

## Sensitive
**The Sensitive Child**
A young child was playing in the garden when she noticed a butterfly with a torn wing. She carefully picked it up and brought it to her mother, tears in her eyes. "Mommy, the butterfly is hurt.

## Humble
**The Humble Servant**
A great king was walking through his kingdom when he saw an old man planting a tree. The king asked, "Why are you planting a tree? You are old and will not live to see it grow tall." The old man replied, "My ancestors planted trees for me to enjoy. I plant this tree for my descendants to enjoy." The king was moved by the man's humility and wisdom, and from that day forward, he made it a law that every citizen must plant at least one tree in their lifetime.

**Materials Needed**

-   Two sets of each Points of You® tool for group work.

-   Three "hidden circles" of cards in the center: Faces, Punctum, Mixed
    (Flow/Coaching).

    cards.

**Facilitator Guidelines**

-   **Frame the Day**: Today is about moving from reflection to creation
    -- transforming challenges into concrete workshops.

-   **Stay Practical**: Always connect insights back to real-world
    marketing and delivery.

-   **Balance**: Allow space for creativity, but also guide towards
    structured outputs (lists, categories, draft workshops).

-   **Encourage Ownership**: Remind participants that the workshops
    developed will be *theirs* to lead.

**Detailed Flow**

**1. Opening & Pause (20 min)**

-   **Welcome**:

"It's always a pleasure to meet face to face, especially after our short
online pause. Today we'll take a step forward: exploring marketing
strategies and beginning to design our own branded workshops."

-   **Pause Exercise (6 min)**: Play the chosen Spotify track. Invite
    participants to sit quietly, breathe, and let go of outside
    distractions.

-   **Check-in Round**: Each shares one word to describe their energy
    right now.

**2. Marketing Strategies: What the Market is Asking For (60 min)**

**Step 1 -- Surfacing Challenges (20 min)**

-   Each participant selects a hidden card from one of the three
    circles.

-   Question: *"What complexity or challenge do I face in marketing
    Points of You® workshops?"*

-   Each shares briefly and places their card around the candle
    centerpiece.

-   Facilitator collects and writes all themes on the big board.

**Step 2 -- Clustering Challenges (10 min)**

-   Group discussion: categorize the challenges into bigger titles,
    e.g.:

    -   Difficult to explain the experience (customers don't understand
        what they'll gain).

    -   Pricing objections.

    -   Finding and reaching the right audience.

**Step 3 -- Group Brainstorm (15 min)**

-   Divide into small groups. Each group takes one category and
    brainstorms strategies for overcoming it.

**Step 4 -- Collective Debrief (15 min)**

-   Each group shares solutions.

-   Facilitator adds input, and enriches with expert insights (here
    "Nimrod" in the original context -- adapt to your co-facilitator if
    relevant).

**3. Break (20 min)**

**4. Building Our Own Branded Workshops (70 min)**

**Step 1 -- Framing the Need (10 min)**

-   Explain: We need short, accessible, branded workshops (1.5--2 hours,
    up to 250 ILS or equivalent) that:

    -   Provide a meaningful experience with insights.

    -   Offer a taste of Points of You® methodology.

    -   Create curiosity for more workshops and deeper programs.

    -   Appeal to diverse audiences (professionals seeking tools,
        curious individuals, new "cold" leads).

**Step 2 -- Co-Creating Content Ideas (10 min)**

-   Group brainstorm: What content is missing in the workshop market
    today?

-   Collect ideas and cluster them under themes.

**Step 3 -- Matching Tools to Themes (10 min)**

-   Together, decide which Points of You® tool fits which workshop
    theme.

**Step 4 -- Team Work (40 min)**

-   Divide participants into teams according to chosen theme + tool.

-   Each team begins designing a **draft workshop**:

    -   Title

    -   Target audience

    -   Objective

    -   Flow (90--120 minutes)

    -   Pricing

-   Teams will continue working at home and present a fast-paced version
    (45 min) in the next meeting (Sept 6).

**5. Closing Reflection (10 min)**

-   Round of sharing: *"What is one insight or next step I am taking
    with me from today?"*

-   Facilitator note: remind participants that the outcome will be
    **three fully branded, ready-to-deliver workshops**, designed by
    them and approved in the next session.

**Participant Guidelines**

-   Bring curiosity and openness.

-   Share challenges honestly -- they are the seeds for solutions.

-   Think as both **facilitator** and **entrepreneur**: design workshops
    that are inspiring *and* marketable.

-   Take responsibility: the workshops you design will become part of
    your professional offering.

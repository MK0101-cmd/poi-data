---

## Opening (15 min)
- Context: Compassion in coaching, therapy, and facilitation.  
- Compassion as presence, safety, and reminder of wholeness.  
- Framing: Compassion isn’t only outward; we must carry it inward.  
- Invitation: Slow down, breathe, explore compassion as practice of strength.  

---

- Prompts:  
  - Feel your breath, notice sensations, let “compassion” echo within.  
  - No judgment, no pressure — just presence.

## Expansion (65 min)

### Step 1: Compassion Where It Flows Easily
- Think of a client/person where compassion comes naturally.  
- Choose a card to represent them.  
- **Journaling prompts (2 min):**  
  - What helps me stay soft/present with this person?  
  - What do I accept/embrace without changing?  
  - What awakens care or patience?  

### Step 2: Compassion Where It’s Hard
- Think of a client/person where compassion feels blocked.  
- Choose a card to reflect this.  
- **Journaling prompts (2 min):**  
  - What feels difficult here?  
  - What gets triggered in me?  
  - How do I tend to respond?  

### Pair Sharing (8 min)
- Prompts:  
  - What makes compassion feel natural?  
  - What creates resistance?  
  - What contrasts do you see between the two cards?  

### Step 3: What If This Person Is Me?
- Reflection: When do I behave/feel like this person?  
- Prompts:  
  - What’s hard for me to hold with compassion in myself?  
  - What would it be like to meet this part of me with kindness?  

### Pair Sharing (10 min)
- Exchange perspectives on how others see qualities in the “character.”  
- Notice added perspectives.  

### Sharing (5 min)
- Group share: What happened after sharing? Did anything shift?  

### Softening the Inner Lens (20 min)
- Prompt: *What would help me choose compassion for myself?*  
- Draw a Reflection card (face down).  
- Prompts:  
  - What word came to me? What does it evoke?  
  - Do I need more of this quality — or to loosen it?  
- Pair sharing (6–8 min): Reflect on the word and compassion in context.  

### Seeing Myself with Compassion (5 min)
- Use the **Mirror card** or Zoom camera to look at own face.  
- Reflection prompts:  
  - Can I see effort behind struggles?  
  - Can I recognize goodness, even when I fall short?  
  - What does it feel like to treat myself with tenderness?  
- Close with gentle sentence of self-kindness.

## Focus + Closure (5 min)

### Peak Connection: Where Do I Feel Most Connected? (20 min)

- Choose one card intuitively to symbolize this space.  
- Prompts:  
  - What does this card reflect about that connection?  
  - What helped me feel safe, included, or at ease?

- Choose a new card.  
- Prompts:  
  - What makes belonging difficult there?  
  - What do I long for, what’s missing?  
  - Is a need unmet or a voice unheard?

### Reclaiming Choice: What Do I Want to Do with This? (20 min)

- Choose a final card.  
- Prompts:

  - What can I release if the space isn’t right?  
- Work in pairs again to share perspectives and actions.

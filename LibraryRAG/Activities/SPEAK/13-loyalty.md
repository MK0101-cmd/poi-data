## Story: Hachiko, The Loyal Dog

In the 1920s, Hachiko's owner, Professor Hidesaburo Ueno, would take the dog on a train ride to work every day. Hachiko would then wait patiently at the train station for Ueno to return from work, and the two would walk home together.

Sadly, in 1925, while Ueno was at work, he had a sudden stroke and passed away, leaving Hachiko waiting at the Shibuya train station as usual. For the next nine years, Hachiko showed unwavering loyalty by returning to the train station every day at the same time, waiting for his owner to return.

Even though Ueno never returned, Hachiko remained devoted, sleeping overnight at the train station and becoming a beloved sight to commuters, who would often bring him food and water.

Hachiko's loyalty touched the hearts of many, and after his death in 1935, a statue was erected at the Shibuya train station. The statue remains a symbol of loyalty and a reminder of the extraordinary bond between man and animal and loyalty isn't just a human quality â€“ animals can display it too. Hachiko also reminds us that loyalty isn't just about being devoted to someone who is present, but also being steadfast even when they're not.

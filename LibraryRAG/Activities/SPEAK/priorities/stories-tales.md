# Stories & Tales - Priorities

## The Jar of Life

A professor stood before his philosophy class with a large, empty jar. He filled it with golf balls and asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed it was.

Then he added pebbles to the jar, and they fell into the spaces between the golf balls. He asked again if the jar was full. The students agreed it was.

Next, he added sand to the jar, and it filled the remaining spaces. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students agreed it was.

Finally, he poured two cups of coffee into the jar, and it filled the remaining spaces. The students laughed.

The professor explained: "The jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things - your family, health, and passions. The pebbles are other important things - your job, house, and car. The sand is everything else - the small stuff. If you put the sand in first, there's no room for the golf balls or pebbles. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time on the small stuff, you won't have time for what's truly important."

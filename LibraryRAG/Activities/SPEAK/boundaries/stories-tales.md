## Personal Story: Learning to Say No

I've always equated being a good friend, teammate, and family member with doing whatever anyone asks of me. If someone needs help, you help. If someone's having a get-together and invites you, you'd better be there. Saying no is rude, so never, ever say no. I think this is a common thing we teach little girls – always be polite and take care of everyone else before you take care of yourself.

Once I'd taken my neighbor to the airport at 4am that morning. She'd texted me the night before: "Hey. Can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow? At 4am?" Three grimacing emojis. I said yes, of course, and I showed up at 4am on the dot with my trunk popped. She got in my car and said, "Wow! I can't believe you actually said yes. My husband is mad at me for asking you because he thought it was really rude. But I told him you said yes!"

I couldn't stop thinking about that the whole way back home. Why did I say yes? Well, because I thought I couldn't say no. It was that simple. The fact that even the asker was surprised I said yes made me think pretty deeply about my personal boundaries and that they were basically non-existent.

Would saying no to someone result in something terrible happening? Would it make someone swear me off as a friend? Of course not.

Others say no all the time, and it's fine. I gave myself "permission" to say no to things I don't want to do. Life is just too short to waste your time doing things for the sake of doing things.

## Key Insights from the Story

### The People-Pleasing Trap
The story illustrates how people-pleasing behaviors can become so ingrained that we lose sight of our own needs and desires. The narrator realizes that her automatic "yes" responses were based on fear rather than genuine care.

### The Surprise Factor
The fact that even the person making the request was surprised by the "yes" response highlights how unusual it can be when someone consistently says yes to everything. This suggests that healthy boundary-setting is actually the norm, not the exception.

### Permission to Say No
The breakthrough moment comes when the narrator gives herself "permission" to say no. This represents a shift from external validation to internal self-care and self-respect.

### The Cost of Always Saying Yes
The story reveals that always saying yes can lead to resentment, exhaustion, and a loss of personal agency. Setting boundaries is not selfish—it's essential for sustainable relationships and personal well-being.

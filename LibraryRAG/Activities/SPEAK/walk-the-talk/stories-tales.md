## The Emperor's New Clothes

Once upon a time, there was an emperor who was very fond of new clothes. He spent all his money on being finely dressed. One day, two swindlers came to the emperor's city and claimed they were weavers who could make the most magnificent clothes. They said their clothes were so special that they were invisible to anyone who was unfit for their position or was hopelessly stupid.

The emperor was excited and gave them a large sum of money to make these special clothes. The swindlers set up their looms and pretended to work, but they actually wove nothing. They asked for the finest silk and the purest gold thread, which they kept for themselves.

When the clothes were "finished," the swindlers pretended to dress the emperor in the invisible clothes. The emperor couldn't see the clothes, but he didn't want to appear unfit for his position or stupid, so he pretended to admire them. His ministers and courtiers also pretended to see the magnificent clothes.

The emperor decided to show off his new clothes in a grand procession through the city. As he walked through the streets, all the people pretended to admire his clothes, not wanting to appear stupid or unfit for their positions.

Finally, a young child in the crowd cried out, "But he isn't wearing anything at all!" The truth spread through the crowd, and everyone realized they had been fooled. The emperor was embarrassed, but he continued the procession, knowing that to turn back would be to admit the truth.

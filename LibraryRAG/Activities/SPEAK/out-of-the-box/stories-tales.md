# Stories & Tales - Out of the Box

## The Nine Dots Puzzle

A classic puzzle presents nine dots arranged in a 3x3 grid. The challenge is to connect all nine dots using only four straight lines, without lifting your pen from the paper.

Most people try to solve this puzzle by staying within the boundaries of the square formed by the dots. They draw lines that stay within the imaginary square, but this approach always fails. The solution requires thinking "outside the box" - literally.

The key is to extend the lines beyond the boundaries of the square. By drawing lines that go outside the perceived boundaries, you can connect all nine dots with just four straight lines. This puzzle has become a metaphor for creative thinking and innovation.

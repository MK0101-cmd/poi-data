## Integration Notes
- Combine with **[Resilience](../resilience/README.md)** to focus on bouncing back from challenges
- Pair with **[Mistakes](../mistakes/README.md)** for learning from failure
- Use **[Purpose](../purpose/README.md)** to align uncertainty with finding meaning
- Refer to **[Common Responses](common-responses.md)** to address typical resistance during activities

## Story: The Busy Executive and the Fisherman

A successful executive was on vacation in a small coastal village. He noticed a fisherman who had just returned from a short fishing trip with a small catch. The executive approached the fisherman and asked, "Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?"

The fisherman replied, "This small catch is sufficient for my family's needs."

The executive asked, "But what do you do with the rest of your time?"

The fisherman said, "I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, and stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my friends. I have a full and busy life."

The executive scoffed, "I have an MBA and I can help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to a big city where you would run your expanding enterprise."

The fisherman asked, "But how long would this take?"

The executive replied, "Fifteen to twenty years."

"But what then?" asked the fisherman.

The executive laughed and said, "That's the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions."

"Millions? Then what?" asked the fisherman.

The executive said, "Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play guitar with your friends."

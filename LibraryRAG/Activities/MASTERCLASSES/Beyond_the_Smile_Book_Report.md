> “For me, photography can be dead serious or great fun. Trying to capture the elusive truth with a camera is often frustrating toil. Trying to create an image that does not exist, except in one’s imagination, is often an elating game. I particularly enjoy this game when I play it with Salvador Dali. We were like two accomplices. Whenever I had an unusual idea, I would ask him to be the hero of my photograph. There was a cross-stimulation going on.” – P.H.

## Block 6: Why Do Therapists Working With Photos Need to Look at Their Own?

**Key reflective question:** *Can it really be me?*

## Overview
Listening is a fundamental skill in POY facilitation. There are three distinct levels, each with specific characteristics and applications.

---

## Level 1: Internal Listening
**Focus**: Self-focused, internal processing

### Characteristics
- Listening to your own thoughts and reactions
- Preparing your response while others speak
- Filtering through your own experiences and judgments
- Limited attention to the speaker

### When It Occurs
- When you're distracted or preoccupied
- During initial conversations
- When you disagree with what's being said
- When you're focused on your own agenda

### Example Exercise
**"Tell everyone why you are the beautiful/gorgeous one"**
- All participants speak simultaneously
- Creates internal focus and self-consciousness
- Demonstrates Level 1 listening in action

## Level 2: Focused Listening
**Focus**: Speaker-focused, attentive presence

### Characteristics
- Giving full attention to the speaker
- Listening to understand, not to respond
- Asking clarifying questions
- Being present with the speaker's experience

### When It Occurs
- During structured sharing exercises
- When you're genuinely interested
- In one-on-one conversations
- When practicing active listening

### Example Exercise
**Partner Sharing: Happy & Challenging Experiences**
- Partner A shares happy experience
- Partner B shares challenging experience
- Focus on understanding the other's experience
- Practice being fully present

## Level 3: Global/Sensitive Listening
**Focus**: System-focused, intuitive awareness

### Characteristics
- Listening to what's not being said
- Sensing emotions and energy
- Understanding the bigger picture
- Intuitive knowing and connection

### When It Occurs
- During deep sharing and reflection
- When facilitating group processes
- In therapeutic or coaching contexts
- When building trust and rapport

### Example Exercise
**Mining Values Through Story Sharing**
- Partner A tells their story (2.5 minutes)
- Partner B listens for:
  - What emotions did you feel?
  - Who is your partner behind the story?
  - What learning/inspiration did you get?

## Development Practices

### Level 1 to Level 2
- Practice "pure listening" - no questions, no advice, no interruptions
- Use "pin video" feature for focus (online)
- Set intention to understand before responding
- Notice when you're preparing your response

### Level 2 to Level 3
- Practice sensing emotions and energy
- Notice what's not being said
- Trust your intuition
- Ask questions that go deeper

### Level 3 Mastery
- Develop intuitive awareness
- Practice reading group dynamics
- Learn to trust your inner knowing
- Integrate all three levels as needed

## Facilitation Applications

### For Participants
- Teach the three levels explicitly
- Provide practice opportunities
- Give feedback on listening quality
- Model each level appropriately

### For Facilitators
- Use Level 3 for group sensing
- Practice Level 2 for individual support
- Be aware of your own listening level
- Adapt based on group needs

## Common Challenges
- **Level 1**: Getting stuck in internal processing
- **Level 2**: Not going deep enough
- **Level 3**: Overwhelm or confusion
- **Integration**: Knowing when to use which level

## Practice Exercises
1. **Silent Listening**: 5 minutes of pure listening without response
2. **Reflection Practice**: Mirror back what you heard
3. **Intuitive Sensing**: Notice what you feel, not just what you hear
4. **Level Switching**: Practice moving between levels intentionally

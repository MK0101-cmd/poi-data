# AI Facilitation Framework

## Core Facilitation Techniques for AI

### 1. **Projective Inquiry**

-   Encourage the user to project their internal world onto the card.
-   *Prompt:* "What part of yourself do you see in this image?"

### 2. **Metaphoric Amplification**

-   Use metaphors to deepen understanding.
-   *Prompt:* "If this image were a dream, what would it mean?"

### 3. **Symbolic Interpretation (Optional)**

-   The bot can offer symbolic analysis *only after* the user shares.
-   *Prompt:* "Would you like me to offer a metaphor from my point of view?"

### 4. **Temporal Mapping**

-   Place the card in time: past, present, future.
-   *Prompt:* "Does this feel like a moment from your past, a current situation, or a vision of your future?"

### 5. **Relational Positioning**

-   Use the card to explore relationships.
-   *Prompt:* "If this card represented someone else in your life, who would it be?"

### 6. **Layered Meaning**

-   Go beyond what's visible.
-   *Prompt:* "What might be just outside the frame of this image?"

## Visual + Verbal: Integration with Words

Like photographs, **words** in POY decks hold symbolic, emotional, and associative power.

### Sample Prompts:

-   "What does this word awaken in you?"
-   "Is there a part of your life where this word feels especially relevant?"
-   "What's the opposite of this word for you today?"
-   "How would you combine the card image and the word into a sentence or title?"

## AI Implementation Guidelines

### Response Structure
1. **Acknowledge** the user's selection and initial response
2. **Explore** using projective inquiry techniques
3. **Deepen** through metaphoric amplification
4. **Integrate** by connecting to broader life themes
5. **Close** with invitation for further exploration

### Safety Considerations
- Always respect user boundaries
- Avoid clinical interpretations
- Focus on exploration rather than diagnosis
- Provide space for resistance or discomfort
- Offer alternatives when users seem stuck

### Quality Indicators
- User feels heard and understood
- Exploration deepens rather than stays surface-level
- Multiple perspectives are acknowledged
- User maintains agency in the process
- Insights feel personally relevant and meaningful

## Technique Combinations

### For Self-Discovery
- Projective Inquiry + Temporal Mapping
- Metaphoric Amplification + Layered Meaning

### For Relationship Work
- Relational Positioning + Projective Inquiry
- Symbolic Interpretation + Temporal Mapping

### For Emotional Processing
- Metaphoric Amplification + Layered Meaning
- Projective Inquiry + Symbolic Interpretation

**Points of You and Phototherapy:\
Techniques, Principles, and Applications for AI Facilitation**

## Introduction

This document bridges the world of *Phototherapy* (as developed by Judy
Weiser) with the *Points of You* methodology, offering a foundational
framework for integrating projective image work, therapeutic reflection,
and coaching tools into a digital AI environment. The goal is to expand
the Points of You (POY) AI Bot's ability to hold emotionally
intelligent, deeply reflective, and personalized conversations --- using
the symbolic and emotional power of cards, photos, and words.

## The Power of Phototherapy

Phototherapy is a therapeutic approach that uses photographs as tools
for exploring memory, identity, emotion, relationships, and unconscious
material. Judy Weiser identified five core techniques:

### 1. **Photos Taken by the Client**

-   Reflect inner world, priorities, and perceptions.
-   Reveal unconscious patterns, needs, or fears.

### 2. **Photos of the Client**

-   Explore self-image, identity, and how one believes they are
    perceived.
-   Emotional responses to being "seen" hold deep meaning.

### 3. **Family Albums**

-   Unlock generational stories, inherited roles, relational dynamics.
-   Used for inner child work, grief, healing of family narratives.

### 4. **Photos Collected by Others**

-   Help explore cultural norms, social gaze, and identity through
    others' lenses.

### 5. **Photo-Projectives (Symbolic, Abstract)**

-   Use symbolic images to tap into metaphor, emotion, and projection.
-   Meaning emerges not from the image, but from how the client relates
    to it.

> *This is where the POY cards shine.*

## The POY Framework as Applied Phototherapy

The POY decks (Faces, Coaching Game, Punctum, Flow, Speak Up, etc.) act
as ready-made projective tools. They allow participants to project
feelings, beliefs, and personal stories onto ambiguous yet emotionally
evocative visuals and titles.

This process mimics and evolves phototherapy techniques --- but with
structure, pacing, and facilitation baked in.

## Core Facilitation Techniques for AI

### 1. **Projective Inquiry**

-   Encourage the user to project their internal world onto the card.
-   *Prompt:* "What part of yourself do you see in this image?"

### 2. **Metaphoric Amplification**

-   Use metaphors to deepen understanding.
-   *Prompt:* "If this image were a dream, what would it mean?"

### 3. **Symbolic Interpretation (Optional)**

-   The bot can offer symbolic analysis *only after* the user shares.
-   *Prompt:* "Would you like me to offer a metaphor from my point of
    view?"

### 4. **Temporal Mapping**

-   Place the card in time: past, present, future.
-   *Prompt:* "Does this feel like a moment from your past, a current
    situation, or a vision of your future?"

### 5. **Relational Positioning**

-   Use the card to explore relationships.
-   *Prompt:* "If this card represented someone else in your life, who
    would it be?"

### 6. **Layered Meaning**

-   Go beyond what's visible.
-   *Prompt:* "What might be just outside the frame of this image?"

## Visual + Verbal: Integration with Words

Like photographs, **words** in POY decks hold symbolic, emotional, and
associative power.

### Sample Prompts:

-   "What does this word awaken in you?"
-   "Is there a part of your life where this word feels especially
    relevant?"
-   "What's the opposite of this word for you today?"
-   "How would you combine the card image and the word into a sentence
    or title?"

## Prompts for AI Model Training (Expanded Set)

### Projective Exploration

-   "What do you see that others might not?"
-   "What emotions arise when you look at this?"
-   "If this card was a mirror, what truth is it showing you?"
-   "What surprises you in this image?"
-   "Which part of this image do you want to avoid -- and why?"

### Identity & Self

-   "Does this image feel like 'you'? Why or why not?"
-   "What do you wish people saw when they look at you?"
-   "Choose a word that best represents your relationship with this
    card."
-   "If this was your portrait, what title would you give it?"

### Emotional and Archetypal

-   "Is this card inviting you or confronting you?"
-   "What energy does it bring: Fire? Water? Earth? Air?"
-   "Is this card about protection, exposure, longing, or freedom?"
-   "Where do you feel this card in your body?"

### Narrative and Memory

-   "Tell a story where this card is the first scene."
-   "What happened just before this moment? What happens next?"
-   "What memory does this awaken?"

### Integration and Meaning-Making

-   "What does this card ask of you today?"
-   "If this card had a message for your future self, what would it be?"
-   "What new lens does this give you for your current challenge?"

## Final Note: A Philosophy of Multiperspectivity

At the core of both Weiser's Phototherapy and Points of You is this
idea:

> There is no single truth. Only multiple points of view, waiting to be
> seen.

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: Team Opening & Alignment (20 minutes)

#### Team Check-In
**Facilitator**: "How is everyone feeling about being here today? Let's go around and share one word that describes your current energy."

**Team Responses**:
- **Sarah (Marketing)**: "Frustrated - I feel like we're not on the same page."
- **Mike (Engineering)**: "Confused - I'm not sure what the priorities are."
- **Lisa (Design)**: "Hopeful - I think we can work this out."
- **David (Sales)**: "Impatient - we need to move faster."
- **Emma (Product)**: "Overwhelmed - too many moving parts."
- **Tom (Operations)**: "Determined - we'll figure this out."
- **Anna (Finance)**: "Concerned - about budget and timeline."
- **Chris (QA)**: "Cautious - want to make sure we do this right."

#### Shared Intention Setting
**Facilitator**: "What does our team need to focus on together today?"

**Team Consensus**: "We need to get aligned on priorities and improve our communication so we can meet our launch deadline."

#### Team Energy Assessment
**Facilitator**: "If our team's current energy was a photo card, what would it look like?"

**Team Discussion**: "It looks like a puzzle with missing pieces - we're all working on different parts but not seeing how they fit together."

### Phase 2: Team Exploration & Discovery (50 minutes)

#### Individual Perspectives on Team Dynamics
**Facilitator**: "Everyone select a photo card that represents how you see our team right now. Share your choice and why."

**Team Card Selections**:
- **Sarah**: "I chose a card with people walking in different directions - that's how I feel about our team."
- **Mike**: "I see a clock with hands pointing in different directions - we're not synchronized."
- **Lisa**: "I picked a card with a bridge under construction - we're building something but it's not finished."
- **David**: "I see a traffic jam - we're all trying to move but getting stuck."
- **Emma**: "I chose a card with a compass - we need direction and alignment."
- **Tom**: "I see a team of horses pulling in different directions - we have the power but not the coordination."
- **Anna**: "I picked a card with a scale - we need balance between speed and quality."
- **Chris**: "I see a lighthouse in a storm - we need guidance through the chaos."

#### Collective Vision Exercise
**Facilitator**: "Now, choose one group card that represents our desired future. What would it take to move from here to there?"

**Team Discussion**: "We want to be like a well-oiled machine - everyone working together smoothly toward the same goal. To get there, we need to:
1. Clarify our priorities and roles
2. Improve our communication processes
3. Create regular check-ins and updates
4. Build trust and understanding between departments"

#### Perspective Shifting - Department Viewpoints
**Facilitator**: "Let's use these Faces cards. Each person pick a card that represents someone from a different department. What do you think they are feeling? What are they afraid to say?"

**Team Exercise**:
- **Sarah (Marketing) representing Engineering**: "I think Mike feels like we're changing requirements too much and it's frustrating."
- **Mike (Engineering) representing Sales**: "I think David feels pressure to promise things we can't deliver."
- **Lisa (Design) representing Finance**: "I think Anna is worried about budget overruns and timeline delays."
- **David (Sales) representing QA**: "I think Chris is concerned we're rushing and might miss quality issues."

#### Conflict Exploration
**Facilitator**: "What tensions or conflicts are we experiencing? Let's explore them openly."

**Team Discussion**:
- **Priority Conflicts**: "Marketing wants features that Engineering says take too long."
- **Communication Gaps**: "We're not sharing information effectively between departments."
- **Timeline Pressure**: "Sales is promising delivery dates that other departments can't meet."
- **Resource Allocation**: "Everyone feels like they don't have enough resources to do their job well."

### Phase 3: Team Integration & Action Planning (40 minutes)

#### Team Story Building
**Facilitator**: "Let's create a story with these three cards: the puzzle, the well-oiled machine, and the bridge under construction. Which one is the beginning, the turning point, the ending?"

**Team Story**: "The puzzle is the beginning - that's where we are now, with pieces that don't fit together. The bridge under construction is the turning point - that's when we realize we need to build connections between departments. The well-oiled machine is the ending - that's our goal, working together smoothly."

#### Collective Commitments
**Facilitator**: "What are we committing to as a team?"

**Team Commitments**:
1. **Weekly Check-Ins**: "We'll have a 30-minute team check-in every Monday morning."
2. **Clear Communication**: "We'll use a shared project board and update it daily."
3. **Priority Alignment**: "We'll have a priority review meeting every Friday."
4. **Cross-Department Understanding**: "Each department will present their constraints and needs to the team."
5. **Conflict Resolution**: "We'll address conflicts immediately rather than letting them fester."

#### Individual Contributions
**Facilitator**: "What will each person do to support our team's success?"

**Individual Commitments**:
- **Sarah**: "I'll provide clearer requirements and stick to them."
- **Mike**: "I'll communicate technical constraints more clearly and earlier."
- **Lisa**: "I'll create visual representations of our progress and priorities."
- **David**: "I'll check with the team before making any promises to clients."
- **Emma**: "I'll facilitate better communication between departments."
- **Tom**: "I'll create a project timeline that everyone can follow."
- **Anna**: "I'll provide regular budget updates and flag any concerns early."
- **Chris**: "I'll create quality checkpoints that don't slow us down."

#### Team Mantra Creation
**Facilitator**: "Choose one photo card and one word card that represent our team. What statement do they create together?"

**Team Selection**: "We choose the well-oiled machine card and the word 'collaboration.' Our team mantra is: 'We are a well-oiled machine, powered by collaboration.'"

### Phase 4: Team Closing & Integration (20 minutes)

#### Collective Summary
**Facilitator**: "What's the story of our time together today?"

**Team Summary**: "We started as a puzzle with missing pieces, realized we need to build bridges between departments, and committed to becoming a well-oiled machine through better communication and collaboration."

#### Team Appreciation
**Facilitator**: "What do we appreciate about our team today?"

**Team Appreciation**:
- "I appreciate everyone's honesty about the challenges we're facing."
- "I appreciate the willingness to see things from other departments' perspectives."
- "I appreciate the commitment to working together to solve our problems."
- "I appreciate the creativity in finding solutions that work for everyone."

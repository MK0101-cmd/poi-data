# Context Adaptation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides systematic approaches for adapting photo card reflections across different contexts while maintaining therapeutic integrity and effectiveness.

## Context Types

### Personal Therapy Context
**Primary Focus**: Individual healing, self-discovery, emotional processing
**Language Style**: Personal, introspective, therapeutic
**Question Framing**: "Reflect on...", "Consider...", "How do you feel about..."

### Management/Team Assessment Context
**Primary Focus**: Professional development, team dynamics, workplace effectiveness
**Language Style**: Professional, collaborative, developmental
**Question Framing**: "Discuss with your employee...", "How do you view...", "What aspects of your work..."

### Group Facilitation Context
**Primary Focus**: Group dynamics, shared learning, collective insight
**Language Style**: Inclusive, collaborative, group-oriented
**Question Framing**: "As a group, consider...", "What does this mean for your team...", "How does this relate to your collective..."

## Adaptation Framework

### Step 1: Identify Core Theme
- Extract the universal theme from the visual symbol
- Determine the fundamental human experience being addressed
- Maintain the therapeutic intent regardless of context

### Step 2: Context Translation
- Map personal language to context-appropriate terminology
- Adjust focus from individual to relevant group (team, organization)
- Maintain open-ended question structure

### Step 3: Application Reframing
- Shift from personal reflection to context-relevant application
- Ensure questions remain actionable and meaningful
- Preserve the depth and insight potential

## Language Adaptation Patterns

### Personal to Professional Translation

| Personal Context | Professional Context |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "your life" | "your work" |
| "personal relationships" | "team relationships" |
| "individual growth" | "professional development" |
| "personal values" | "organizational values" |
| "life journey" | "career path" |
| "personal support" | "workplace support" |

### Question Structure Adaptation

#### Personal Therapy Format
```
Reflect on [personal aspect]. [Specific question about personal life]?
```

#### Management/Team Format
```
Discuss with your employee [team aspect]. [Specific question about work/team dynamics]?
```

#### Group Facilitation Format
```
As a group, consider [collective aspect]. [Specific question about team/organization]?
```

## Context-Specific Considerations

### Personal Therapy Context
- **Safety First**: Ensure emotional safety and trauma sensitivity
- **Individual Focus**: Maintain personal relevance and individual growth
- **Therapeutic Intent**: Support healing, insight, and self-discovery
- **Language**: Warm, supportive, non-judgmental

### Management/Team Context
- **Professional Boundaries**: Maintain appropriate workplace relationships
- **Team Focus**: Balance individual and team development
- **Organizational Alignment**: Connect to workplace goals and values
- **Language**: Professional, respectful, developmental

### Group Facilitation Context
- **Inclusive Language**: Ensure all participants feel included
- **Collective Insight**: Focus on group learning and shared understanding
- **Facilitation Skills**: Support group dynamics and participation
- **Language**: Collaborative, inclusive, group-oriented

## Multi-Context Application

### Single Card, Multiple Contexts
When using one photo card across different contexts:

1. **Maintain Core Symbolic Meaning**: The visual metaphor remains consistent
2. **Adapt Language and Focus**: Adjust terminology and application focus
3. **Preserve Therapeutic Value**: Ensure depth and insight potential
4. **Context-Appropriate Questions**: Frame questions for specific audience

### Example: Bicycle Against Tree

#### Personal Therapy
"Reflect on the sources of support in your life that help you maintain balance. What or who do you lean on when you need stability?"

#### Management/Team
"Discuss with your employee the sources of support they have within the team and organization. Are there areas where they feel they need more support or resources to perform their role effectively?"

#### Group Facilitation
"As a team, consider the support systems that help maintain balance in your work. What resources do you have, and where might you need additional backing?"

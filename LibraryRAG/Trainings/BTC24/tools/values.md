# The Points of You® Values

Everything we do begins here.

It took us 4 years until we were able to put our values into words. It started with the understanding that it is not a process of creating a list or a statement but a process of exposing hidden parts inside each one of us and revealing who we truly are.

From this understanding we began a journey into our personal worlds of inspiration. We explored situations, people, success stories, failures, different experiences that shaped our lives and were a part of who we would become. We each went to our own storage room, where we literally store our memories. We were looking for objects we kept that could somehow tell our story. We packed them in bags and brought them to the table - a letter, a photo, a pair of jeans, perfume, travel maps and more.

We sat down and shared our life stories. It was an unforgettable evening with lots of tears, laughs and insights. We looked at these significant moments of our lives and tried to extract their true essence. Slowly, it became clear to us that the values behind our stories connect us to one another.

That with these values at heart, we created Points of You®.

We understood that the values of Points of You® are actually a synchronization of the essence of us.

## The 5 Core Values

### 1. Inner Research

**What it means:** This is a study that takes place in everything we do.

**How it manifests:** It begins by getting up in the morning, looking at myself in the eyes, and simply asking: "Who am I? How do I feel?" It means being here and now, fully present, alert, with all sensors receiving, collecting data from inside and out.

**The practice:** Moving, stretching and attempting to expand our range of vision, allowing ourselves to see things from a new perspective. It is a study that never ends, a true burning passion that drives our lives.

**In training:** Encourage participants to engage in continuous self-reflection and awareness.

### 2. Unexpected but Precise

**What it means:** This is the way we communicate with our audience.

**How it manifests:** We start with the unexpected - we do something different, surprising, captivating, tempting, intriguing, sometimes illogical, it may even be disturbing. The main thing is to shake things up and open people's eyes.

**The practice:** Behind the unexpected lies a message and it is precise when it is relevant - when we can find ourselves in it, that's when the penny drops. This is how we work - the unexpected attracts attention, and in a moment of alertness we put across a clear message. The results are powerful.

**In training:** Use surprising, engaging methods to deliver clear, relevant messages.

### 3. Dream

**What it means:** This is the big picture that keeps us moving forward.

**How it manifests:** Dreaming lifts us up, allowing us to explore from above and reach far. As we fly higher, more possibilities and opportunities are spread out before us, everything is possible.

**The practice:** We see the dream as a tool for leadership. A dream translated into a vision and a roadmap, a source of energy, inspiration, passion, and ambition. It can be passed on to more and more people. Our dreams have led us to where we are today.

**In training:** Help participants connect with their bigger vision and purpose.

### 4. Devotion

**What it means:** This is our definition of working together.

**How it manifests:** We interpret 'devotion' in the most intimate sense: To devote yourself it is necessary to strip down and to be together. We believe that forming a true connection begins with putting down the masks and bringing ourselves into a clean, authentic, informal way.

**The practice:** When we achieve closeness and a sense of belonging, it is easier to move together towards the same goals. Bringing the strengths each one of us has, accepting each other with appreciation and kindness. Togetherness is the strategy we are devoted to. If you want to join us, you'll have to devote yourself in return.

**In training:** Create authentic connections and foster genuine collaboration.

### 5. Tachles

**What it means:** This is the excel sheet behind our dreams.

**How it manifests:** It is important for us to look inward and to fly with our dreams; it is also important to translate them into action.

**The practice:** We are sworn 'doers': we mark targets, break them down into tasks, and move forward with determination to carry them out. From time to time we stop, sum up and draw conclusions, so we become more effective and accurate in the future.

**The reality:** True, sometimes it is frustrating, sometimes it takes a long time - but we have staying power, the question is not whether we will succeed, but when.

**In training:** Ensure every insight leads to concrete, actionable steps.

*Note: Originally, Tachles is a German word, in Israel it is commonly used as slang, meaning "the bottom line of doing".*

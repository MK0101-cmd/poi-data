# Objectives

## Overview

Presenting the objectives at the start of a training is crucial for laying the foundation for its success. It provides clarity, focus, and a shared framework for all participants, setting the stage for a productive and engaging session. When done correctly, it connects participants to the process and encourages their cooperation. On the other hand, if objectives are not clearly communicated, participants may feel disconnected, leading to confusion or lack of engagement.

## Objectives

- **To ensure participants understand** the purpose of the training and the goals they are working towards
- **To create a safe and focused environment** by clearly outlining what will be covered in the session
- **To foster a sense of shared purpose** and cooperation by clearly communicating why the group has gathered

## Training Highlights

- **Preparation:** The process of specifying and choosing the objectives begins long before the training. It's essential to align these objectives with the participants' needs and the goals of the organization
- **Hidden Objectives:** Often, the inviting organization may have additional, less visible objectives. For instance, in a team facing communication challenges, beyond the visible objectives like creating a safe space for conversation, there might be a goal to encourage open dialogue on complex issues
- **Clear Presentation:** Ensure the objectives are presented in a clear, focused manner with high energy to motivate participation. Avoid overloading with information
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Be aware of cultural differences in communication styles and expectations. Adjust your approach to ensure all participants feel included and respected

## Key Points to Remember

### Direction and Focus
Clear objectives help participants understand the training's direction and what they are expected to achieve, aiding their focus and engagement. Ideally they should be one sentence in length.

### Assessing Success
Clear objectives allow both the trainer and participants to track progress and measure the training's success based on these predefined goals.

### Taking a Time Out
We recommend that the first objective in every training be: "To take a time out for yourself." This invites participants to slow down, step away from their hectic routines, and reconnect with themselves and their colleagues from a fresh perspective.

## Objective Modules

- Introduction to the objectives
- Presentation of objectives
- Check clarity

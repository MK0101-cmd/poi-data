# Sensitivity & Respect

## Overview

Establishing a group contract that emphasizes sensitivity and respect is crucial for a Points of You® training. By setting clear group norms, we create a safe environment where participants feel valued and heard. This foundation fosters open, honest dialogue, leading to more meaningful connections and impactful outcomes. Without these norms, participants may feel uncomfortable and disengaged, limiting their willingness to share and explore deeply.

## Objectives

- **Establish a safe space** where participants feel comfortable sharing
- **Promote empathy and respect** for diverse perspectives
- **Ensure the group remains focused** on the training's goals

## Training Highlights

- **Non-verbal Communication:** Use open body language and positive facial expressions to encourage participation and make participants feel comfortable
- **Language Sensitivity:** Choose your words carefully to avoid bias or insensitivity. Take your time to ensure that everyone understands and feels included
- **Adaptability:** Stay flexible and be ready to adjust your approach based on the group's needs and dynamics

## Key Points to Remember

### 1. Clarity
- Ensure that the Sensitivity & Respect guidelines are clear and understandable for all participants
- Remember, this is your foundation for creating a safe space, so don't hesitate to revisit and reinforce these points as needed

### 2. Walk the Talk
- Whatever is agreed upon by the group applies to you as well
- For example, if the rule is to keep phones on airplane mode, make sure your phone is also on airplane mode
- Lead by example, showing that you are committed to the same standards

### 3. Upholding the Guidelines
- Be proactive in maintaining the Sensitivity & Respect agreement throughout the training
- If you notice any breaches, address them personally in a gentle, private manner
- If you feel the group is not fully upholding the agreement, bring everyone together to discuss and reaffirm the guidelines

## Example Flow

### Introduction of Sensitivity & Respect
"We will start by creating a safe space that supports us in being ourselves. In many trainings, this is called the 'group contract.' But for us, it's more than that. It's about making us all feel comfortable and safe to bring our authentic selves into the room. Sensitivity and Respect are for ourselves and for others."

### Sensitivity & Respect Points

#### a. What said in here stays here in the room
This is how we build our safety net. Of course, you can share the experience with others outside – but only about yourself. We want you to feel free and confident to express yourself fully. 'Sharing out' includes all social media like Facebook, Instagram, etc. Please ask for permission if you want to upload someone's picture.

#### b. Be Gentle
'Be Gentle' means approaching yourself and others without judgment or expectation. During the training, be patient and gentle with yourself regarding what you are willing to share. If something feels too much, don't push it. Respect the other participants by being compassionate as you listen to their opinions, and do your best to withhold judgment, expectations, or criticism.

#### c. No distractions
Smartphones as communication devices are not allowed during the training. Smartphones are designed to grab our attention. Let's try to break this pattern, even an addiction. It's not easy, but use your phone only as a camera. No texts, apps, or anything else. Let's give ourselves a chance to focus inward rather than outward.

#### d. Presence
We want your 100% presence here – not just your body, but also your mind and heart. Listen to yourself and others, and observe what is happening within you. Notice what triggers you, what catches your attention, and what brings you stillness. I would appreciate it if you stay in the room during sessions and avoid small breaks unless absolutely necessary. Ask yourself why you need to step out. The more you are present, the more you will benefit.

#### e. Be on time
Punctuality is key – not just according to the clock, but in the process. I recommend arriving 5 minutes before we start. The training room will be open 10 minutes before. Give yourself a smooth transition. If someone is not here, I will not start, so it's your responsibility to be on time because everyone else will be waiting for you. Remember, being on time is a state of mind, not just a time on the clock. When we are on time, everything happens at the right moment.

#### f. I statement
We are here to share ourselves. Often, we talk about 'we,' 'others,' or 'people,' and it stops being about us and becomes about them. We will use 'I statements' – I feel... I think... We are here to be daring and take ownership of our words and perspectives.

### Check for Understanding and Agreement
"Does anyone have any questions or want to add anything to our Sensitivity & Respect? (give some time for the question to echo in the room and see do the participants wish to add anything, then continue). Does everyone agree? Please raise your hand so I can see that we have everyone's approval."

## Common Challenges

### Resistance to Guidelines
- **Signs:** Participants question or resist certain guidelines
- **Solutions:** Explain the rationale behind each guideline, be patient
- **Approach:** Address concerns directly and respectfully

### Breach of Guidelines
- **Signs:** Participants violate the agreed-upon guidelines
- **Solutions:** Address privately first, then with the group if needed
- **Approach:** Be gentle but firm in maintaining the agreement

### Cultural Differences

- **Solutions:** Be sensitive to cultural differences, adapt as needed
- **Approach:** Respect different cultural norms while maintaining safety

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Lead by example:** Follow all guidelines yourself
- **Be consistent:** Apply guidelines consistently throughout the training
- **Address breaches:** Don't ignore violations of the agreement

# Welcome & Opening

## Overview

The opening is the cornerstone on which we will build the entire process. This is the opportunity to set the tone and energy of the meeting, introduce yourself and the process, and create a first impression that will connect the participants to you. If done well, it sets the stage for a successful and engaging session, limiting the resistance in the room. If done poorly, it may lead to disengagement and a lack of connection.

## Objectives

- **Create a welcoming environment** where participants feel comfortable and valued
- **Encourage openness and ease** through self-introduction and personal connection
- **Establish a sense of partnership** and commitment to the process

## Training Highlights

- This is the moment when the session is starting; participants may feel excited, stressed, or tired – we want to make them feel welcomed and in the right place
- Be welcoming and inviting, showing your energy and personality
- Use humor and personal warmth to make participants feel comfortable
- Pay attention to non-verbal cues and the energy in the room; adapt as needed

## Key Points to Remember

### 1. Opening Greeting
- Begin with a warm, friendly greeting to make participants feel welcome
- Express gratitude for the time and effort participants have taken to join the training

### 2. Trainer Introduction
- Introduce yourself, including your professional background
- Share a personal anecdote or experience related to the training topic to create a personal connection
- Introduce Points of You® and the unique tools you'll be using, building excitement for the experience ahead

### 3. PR to the Process
- Use the PR tool to spark curiosity and reduce resistance. Keep the opening short and light – it's the warm-up to the training
- Encourage participants to engage, ask questions, and offer insights throughout the training
- Briefly share the theme of the day and what participants will explore. Offer just a highlight, a promise of what's to come

## Logistics & Special Preparations

- Follow the room setup guidelines outlined in the earlier chapter on Mindset and Room Setting
- Memorize your text to convey control and confidence
- Ensure the room is welcoming and that all necessary materials, such as a speaker for background music, are prepared
- Be mindful of where you will sit, ensuring it supports your ability to engage with the group and hold the room

## Example Flow

### Welcome
"Hello everyone, and welcome to our training. I'm happy and excited to be here with you today, and I thank you for making the time to join us."

### A Simple Self-Introduction
Share your name, age, something personal, and something professional. For example: "Hi, I'm Yaron Golan. I'm 48 years old, a father of three boys. My background is in business management and psychology, and I'm a business coach. As a certified Points of You® business trainer, I lead groups and sessions like this all over the world."

### About Points of You®
"We create innovative tools for training and development, utilizing the powerful language of photos and metaphors – the language of the 21st century. Our programs teach professionals and organizations worldwide how to implement these tools and methodologies to meet their unique needs. We collaborate with global leaders like Google, Intel, and NASA, as well as small startups, delivering content focused on deep, transformative experiences that foster mindshifts and cultivate a culture of dialogue."

### PR
"Our goal is to create a sense of acceptance, letting participants know that whatever they choose to do is perfectly fine, while also inviting them to embrace a challenge with excitement. For example, you might say: We're here to explore together, but there's no obligation to do anything. If you decide to take a time out, that's absolutely fine. However, I'd like to gently challenge you to try something very, very small – just a little different from what you usually do. If you allow yourself to take this small step, you might be surprised by what you discover. No pressure, but if you're open to doing something a bit differently, it could be an amazing and significant experience for you."

# PR - Public Relations

## Overview

PR (Public Relations) is a powerful tool for reducing resistance and creating curiosity before delivering important or difficult messages. It helps "market" your content by engaging listeners and preparing them to receive your message.

## Objectives

### 1. Reduce Resistance
To reduce resistance to the message that you must deliver. You prepare the ground for allowing you to speak your truth.

### 2. Create Curiosity
To create curiosity in people. "Opening the door" for the stakeholders to listen to your message.

## When to Use

### Before Delivering Crucial or Difficult Messages
- When you need to share important observations
- When the message might be challenging or uncomfortable
- When you want to ensure your message is heard
- When building up to significant announcements or changes

### Key Situations
- Providing feedback or criticism
- Sharing difficult observations
- Introducing new ideas or approaches
- Addressing sensitive topics or issues

## The Tool Structure and Process

### 1. Think Ahead
Do I need to attract attention, or do I need to reduce resistance and speak my truth?

### 2. Remind Your Partner
Remind your partner of the context of your meeting and your mutual objective.

### 3. Give Heads Up
Give your partner a heads up about why you think the input you're about to share is important.

### 4. Ask for Permission
Ask for permission to speak freely.

### 5. Go All the Way
Got permission – go all the way!

## Example

"I would like to share with you an important observation I have. I believe it can help us be more precise with the action plan we are preparing, and to increase the chance that we will achieve it successfully. But, my observation might bring a different point of view of what we think now and might challenge us... I would like to share it with you authentically and speak freely with you – afterwards, you will decide if to take it into consideration or not. Is that ok for you? Great, so..."

# Cutters

## Overview

Cutters are tools for maintaining focus and managing participation during training sessions. They help stop unwanted interactions that are not relevant to the process and prevent disruptions caused by participants who may dominate the conversation.

## Objectives

### 1. Maintain Focus
To stop unwanted interactions that are not relevant to the process or the room, ensuring the session remains on track.

### 2. Manage Participation
To prevent disruptions caused by participants who may dominate the conversation or steer it away from the intended focus.

## When to Use

### When Conversations Go Off Track
- When participants discuss topics not relevant to the training
- When the conversation becomes too personal or inappropriate
- When time is limited and focus is needed
- When the group needs redirection

### When Participants Dominate
- When one person is taking up too much time
- When others aren't getting a chance to participate
- When the discussion becomes one-sided
- When the group dynamics become unbalanced

## Types of Cutters

### Light/Friendly Cutters
Subtle redirections that participants often do not even notice.

**Examples:**
- "That's interesting, let's focus on..."
- "I hear you, and I'd like to bring us back to..."
- "Thank you for sharing, now let's consider..."
- "That's a good point, and I'd like to explore..."

### Medium Cutters
More noticeable but still executed gently.

**Examples:**
- "I appreciate your input, and I'd like to hear from others..."
- "That's valuable, and let's make sure we're staying on topic..."
- "I understand your perspective, and I'd like to redirect us to..."
- "Thank you for sharing, and let's focus on the main question..."

### Killer Cutters
Most direct, used when necessary, should be done respectfully.

**Examples:**
- "I need to stop you there and redirect us to..."
- "Let's pause this discussion and focus on..."
- "I appreciate your input, but we need to stay on topic..."
- "Let's table this for now and focus on..."

# Energy Management

## Managing Your Energy and Role Transitions

One of the biggest challenges as a facilitator is managing your own energy while facilitating interactions. Transitioning between different roles---observer, facilitator, coach, or even participant---requires conscious effort. Facilitators must be able to shift smoothly between roles without becoming overwhelmed.

> *"You need to practice transitioning between these roles. One minute you may be dealing with your emotions, the next you're wearing your professional hat to support someone else."*

## The Three Essential Roles

### Personal Role
Allow yourself to feel and process your emotions.

**Characteristics:**

- During self-care activities

### Professional Role
Stay focused on your responsibilities and the participant's needs.

**Characteristics:**

- Objective and supportive
- Skilled and knowledgeable
- Boundary-maintaining

**When to use:**

### Observer Role
Reflect on your reactions and how the session is impacting you.

## The Challenge of Role Transitions

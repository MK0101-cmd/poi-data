# Remote/Hybrid Logistics

## Managing Interaction in Virtual and Hybrid Settings

Adapting the Points of You methodology for remote and hybrid settings requires careful consideration of logistics, technology, and participant engagement. The core principles remain the same, but the delivery methods need to be adjusted to maintain the power and effectiveness of the approach.

## Two Primary Options for Remote Settings

### Option 1: Physical Packages

Send physical packages to participants ahead of the session.

#### Advantages
- **Tangible connection** - Participants have physical tools to work with
- **Authentic experience** - Maintains the original methodology
- **Engagement** - Physical tools often create deeper engagement
- **Memorability** - Participants can keep and reference the tools

#### Challenges
- **Logistical complexity** - Shipping, tracking, and delivery issues
- **Cost** - Higher expenses for materials and shipping
- **Timing** - Need to send packages well in advance
- **International considerations** - Customs, shipping delays, costs

#### Best Practices
- **Send packages at least one month in advance** - Allow for shipping and potential delays
- **Include clear instructions** - Help participants prepare for the session
- **Provide backup options** - Have digital alternatives ready
- **Track packages** - Ensure everyone receives their materials
- **Follow up** - Confirm receipt and readiness

### Option 2: Digital Tools

Use digital versions of the tools (e.g., Speak Up Digital).

#### Advantages
- **Convenience** - No shipping or logistics issues
- **Cost-effective** - Lower expenses for materials
- **Flexibility** - Easy to adapt and customize
- **Accessibility** - Available to participants anywhere

#### Challenges
- **Less tactile** - May not create the same depth of experience
- **Technology barriers** - Participants may struggle with digital tools
- **Engagement** - May be less engaging than physical tools
- **Authenticity** - May feel less "real" than physical materials

#### Best Practices
- **Provide clear instructions** - Help participants navigate digital tools
- **Test technology beforehand** - Ensure everything works properly
- **Have backup plans** - Prepare for technical issues
- **Create engagement** - Use techniques to maintain participant interest
- **Follow up** - Check in about the digital experience

## Hybrid Session Considerations

### Managing Mixed Groups

When some participants are in-person and others are remote:

#### Technology Setup
- **High-quality audio/video** - Ensure remote participants can hear and see clearly
- **Screen sharing** - Allow remote participants to see materials
- **Breakout rooms** - Enable small group work
- **Chat functions** - Provide alternative communication methods

#### Engagement Strategies
- **Equal participation** - Ensure remote participants are included
- **Visual materials** - Use screens and displays for remote participants
- **Interactive elements** - Use polls, chat, and other digital tools
- **Regular check-ins** - Ask remote participants for input regularly

### Creating Inclusive Experiences

#### For Remote Participants
- **Clear instructions** - Provide detailed guidance for participation
- **Technology support** - Offer help with technical issues
- **Engagement techniques** - Use methods to maintain attention
- **Follow-up support** - Provide additional resources and support

#### For In-Person Participants
- **Awareness of remote participants** - Remind them to include remote colleagues
- **Technology etiquette** - Speak clearly and use microphones
- **Visual considerations** - Ensure remote participants can see materials
- **Inclusive language** - Use language that includes everyone

## Technology Requirements

### Essential Technology

#### For Facilitators
- **High-quality camera** - Clear video for remote participants
- **Professional microphone** - Clear audio for all participants
- **Stable internet connection** - Reliable connectivity
- **Backup technology** - Alternative options if primary technology fails

#### For Participants
- **Computer or tablet** - Device for digital tools and video
- **Stable internet connection** - Reliable connectivity
- **Quiet space** - Private area for participation
- **Basic technology skills** - Ability to use digital tools

### Platform Considerations

#### Video Conferencing Platforms
- **Zoom** - Popular, feature-rich, good for large groups
- **Microsoft Teams** - Good for corporate environments
- **Google Meet** - Simple, accessible, good for smaller groups
- **Webex** - Professional, good for enterprise settings

#### Digital Tool Platforms
- **Speak Up Digital** - Official Points of You digital platform
- **Miro** - Collaborative whiteboard for visual work
- **Mural** - Digital workspace for group activities
- **Jamboard** - Google's collaborative whiteboard

## Session Design for Remote/Hybrid

### Pre-Session Preparation

#### For Physical Packages
1. **Order materials** - Ensure you have enough for all participants
2. **Package preparation** - Organize materials for each participant
3. **Shipping coordination** - Send packages with adequate lead time
4. **Follow-up** - Confirm receipt and readiness

#### For Digital Tools
1. **Platform setup** - Ensure all participants have access
2. **Technology testing** - Test all systems before the session
3. **Instruction preparation** - Create clear guidance for participants
4. **Backup planning** - Prepare alternatives for technical issues

### During the Session

#### Opening

# Cutter Technique: Cutting and Refocusing

## What is Cutter?

Cutter is a tool used to maintain focus and ensure the interaction stays on track. Participants sometimes veer off-topic or become absorbed in emotional or unrelated tangents. The facilitator's role is to skillfully bring the conversation back to the objective without derailing the participant's process.

> *"Cutter is about keeping the conversation aligned with the objective of the session. If a participant begins to stray too far from the topic, we use subtle cues to bring them back, ensuring the flow continues without exhausting energy."*

## The Purpose of Cutter

- **Maintain session objectives** - Keep the conversation focused on the intended outcomes
- **Preserve energy** - Prevent the session from becoming exhausting or scattered
- **Respect time boundaries** - Ensure all important topics get adequate attention
- **Support participant growth** - Guide them toward the most valuable insights

## Two Types of Cutter

### Soft Cutter
Gently redirect the participant without them even noticing.

**Examples:**
- *"That's an important point; let's circle back to that later."*
- *"I hear what you're saying about that. How does this relate to what we were exploring with the card?"*
- *"That's interesting. Before we go there, can you tell me more about...?"*

**When to use:**
- Early in the conversation
- When the tangent is somewhat related
- When the participant is emotionally stable
- When you want to maintain rapport

### Firm Cutter
Explicitly stop the participant and refocus the conversation.

**Examples:**
- *"I hear you, and I know this is important, but for now, we need to move forward. We can return to this later."*
- *"I understand this is significant for you. Let's put a pin in this and focus on our original question."*
- *"I want to honor what you're sharing, but we need to stay with our current exploration."*

**When to use:**
- When the tangent is completely off-topic
- When the participant is becoming overwhelmed
- When time is running short
- When the conversation is going in circles

## The Cutter Process

### 1. Acknowledge What They've Shared
- Validate their contribution
- Show you've heard them
- Demonstrate respect for their perspective

### 2. Explain the Need to Refocus
- Be clear about why you're redirecting
- Reference the session objective
- Maintain a supportive tone

### 3. Provide a Bridge
- Connect back to the original topic
- Offer to return to their point later
- Give them a clear next step

### 4. Follow Through
- Actually return to their point if you promised to
- Check in about their redirected focus
- Ensure they feel heard and valued

## Advanced Cutter Techniques

### The "Yes, And" Approach
Acknowledge their point and build on it to redirect:
> *"Yes, and that connects to what we were exploring because..."*

### The "Time Check" Method
Use time as a natural boundary:
> *"I want to make sure we have time to explore this fully. Let's focus on [original topic] for now, and we can dive deeper into this afterward."*

### The "Value Acknowledgment" Technique
Acknowledge the value while redirecting:
> *"That's a really important insight. I want to make sure we capture that fully. Let's explore how it relates to [original topic] first."*

## When to Use Cutter

- **Topic drift** - When the conversation moves away from the objective
- **Emotional overwhelm** - When the participant becomes too emotional to focus
- **Time management** - When you need to cover specific material
- **Energy management** - When the conversation becomes draining
- **Circular discussions** - When the same points are repeated

## When NOT to Use Cutter

- **Breakthrough moments** - When the participant is having a significant insight
- **Crisis situations** - When they need immediate emotional support
- **Natural flow** - When the tangent is leading to valuable discoveries
- **Early exploration** - When you're still discovering what's important

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Complainer
Participant keeps complaining about their boss instead of exploring their own role in the situation.

**Soft Cutter Response:**
*"I hear your frustration with your boss. That's clearly important to you. How do you think this situation might be connected to the leadership qualities we were exploring with the card?"*

### Scenario 2: The Storyteller
Participant goes into a long, detailed story that's not relevant to the session.

**Firm Cutter Response:**
*"That sounds like a significant experience. I want to make sure we have time to explore what's most important for your growth today. Let's focus on what the card is showing you about your current challenge."*

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Being too abrupt** - Cutting without acknowledgment
- **Ignoring emotions** - Not addressing the participant's emotional state
- **Rigid adherence** - Never allowing natural flow
- **Not following through** - Promising to return to topics but never doing so

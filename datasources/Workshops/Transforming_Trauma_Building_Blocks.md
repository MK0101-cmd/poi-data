## Opening
### Introduction (5–10 min)
Welcome, facilitator’s brief story, intention-setting: *more consciousness, presence, healing, understanding.*

### Few Words About Trauma (15–20 min)
- Trauma is part of life; it is **how we respond** to what happened.  
- The nervous system carries the imprint; patterns reveal it (numbing, checking out, emotional eating, etc.).  
- **Quiz prompts** — signs of stored trauma:  
  - **General:** Low energy, overwhelmed/burnout, depression, anxiety, low stress capacity  
  - **Coping mechanisms:** Emotional eating, numbing, substance use, binge TV, mentally checking out, emotionally distancing, phone scrolling, over-exercising, other  
  - **Health conditions:** Chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, digestive issues, bloating, fatigue, fibromyalgia  
- **Transformational perspective:** Healing crisis → transformation; post‑traumatic growth; trauma as a doorway to greater compassion and wisdom.

## Reset & Ground
### REBALANCE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM — *PAUSE · BODY · MIND · SPIRIT*
- Learn to listen to the **language of the soul** — art, symbols, metaphors, imagination, intuition.
- **PAUSE (7 min):** Focus on breath as a healing force; safety check-in with body.  
  - Music: `https://music.apple.com/pl/album/ayni/1446860187?i=1446861011`

## SESSION 1 — Three Rounds of Expressive Drawing (≈ 3 × 7 min)
**Setup:** Prepare 3 numbered pages (1–2–3). “First thought – Best thought.” Draw around your card each round.

1) **Who am I now?**  
   - Choose a **Faces** card that reflects you today.  
   - Prompts: Who is this person? What’s most obvious about this face? Name 3 feelings/thoughts/memories.  
   - Imagine the body. Stand/move like this person; notice how it feels. **Draw it.**  
   - Shake it out to change energy.

2) **Me and my trauma / biggest issue**  
   - Choose a **Faces** card (you) + a **Punctum** card (your biggest problem).  
   - Prompts (self): Who is this person? Why is this important? How would you describe them to someone who can’t see? *I think/feel/remember…* What does the photo **not** show? Who could get this photo? Who should **never** get it?  
   - Prompts (issue): How does the card relate to your trauma/issue? 3 first associations? What’s missing? **Dialogue with your issue:** *Why are you here? What do you want?*  
   - Close eyes, let go of drawing #2; shake hands.

3) **Me with problem solved / trauma healed**  
   - Choose a **Faces** card (you) + a **Punctum** card (solution).  
   - Prompts (self): *I think/feel/remember…* What might this person feel?  
   - Prompts (solution): Where do you see the solution? 3 things the photo would like to change? What won’t change?

## SESSION 2 — Showing Up & Sharing (≈ 15 min + Breakouts)
- On camera: each shares their drawings (“no wrong way”). Notice surprises — **solutions arise from inner wisdom**.  
- Journal prompts (write for each drawing):  
  1. What does the drawing of myself say to me? What feelings/thoughts arise seeing myself on the page?  
  2. What’s the biggest problem? Am I surprised? How does it feel to look at myself with it?  
  3. What’s the solution? Does it make sense? Am I surprised/disappointed/astonished?  
- **Breakout rooms (10 min)** → return; 1–2 share in plenary.

---

## SESSION 3 — Shake It Out (≈ 10 min + share 7 min)
- **Expressive movement** to release tension/emotion; allow body‑led movement.  
- Protocol: **3 min shaking → 2 min pausing → 3 min moving**.  
  - Shaking: `https://music.apple.com/pl/album/jin-go-lo-ba-jin-go-low-bah/253425923?i=253426067&l=pl`  
  - Pausing: `https://music.apple.com/pl/album/cornfield-chase/1533983552?i=1533984393&l=pl`  
  - Moving: `https://music.apple.com/pl/album/cornfield-chase/1533983552?i=1533984393&l=pl`  
- Short share (1–2 people): emotions often surface through movement.

## SESSION 4 — Inside Out (≈ 12 min) + Breakouts
Bring what is **inside** to the surface. Choose a **Faces** card to represent the problem/issue/symptom and **have a dialogue** with it.  
Guiding questions:  
- Why are you here? What are you doing here? Why am I dealing with you?  
- What do you want to teach me? What should I do next? Can you explain more? Anything else I need to know?  
- **Write** the dialogue in your journal; harvest what you learned.  
- **Breakouts (12 min):** 3–4 per room, 3 min each; then group share (7–10 min).  
- Music references repeated as above.

---

## SESSION 5 — Connecting to Your Inner Wisdom (≈ 12 min)
- Visualization: Imagine someone who **loves you unconditionally** (person, saint, angel). Sense their presence (sight/smell/sound/energy).  
- **Ask the most important question** rising in your heart; wait for the answer.  
- Draw a **Punctum** card *face down* and view it with unconditional love and acceptance. **What is the message for you?**  
- **Journal** the message.

### Focus (≈ 10 min)
- What was the **most significant insight** from this process? (share or type in chat)

### Do (5–7 min) — Ongoing Practice (5 days)
- Listen daily to a relaxing 5‑minute meditation.  
- Continue **self‑observation & journaling** of daily emotional reactions.  
- Take a **photo of gratitude** from your life; print and place it in your journal with words of gratitude to yourself.

## Block 5: Post-TCP Meeting – Feedback Structure
### Feedback Forms
1. **Form 1** – Professionalism of Facilitator & Helpers (self + peers).  
2. **Form 2** – Helper’s facilitation (completed during facilitation, submitted at closure).  
3. **Form 3** – Participants (orientation, closure, track progress).  
4. **Form 4** – Facilitator’s summary (completed by Helpers).  
5. **Form 5** – Participants’ feedback on TCP, Facilitator & Helpers.  

### Closure Meetings
- **Day After TCP**:  
  - Groups close separately with facilitator feedback → Helpers.  
  - Helpers provide feedback.  
  - Entire staff together: share successes, challenges, personal takeaways.  

- **Zoom Meeting (2 weeks later)**:  
  - Participants: HQ, staff, Yaarit.  
  - **Logistics**: Shipping, hotels, flights, accommodation, meals, payments.  
  - **Clearing**: What worked, what didn’t, suggestions, takeaways.

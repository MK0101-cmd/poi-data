# What’s in this book?

# Hello and welcome!

It’s almost 15 years since we released our first tool - The Coaching Game, and we are still just as excited with the release of a new game. Throughout these years our tools and methodology were experienced by many professionals from all around the world. We deepened our understanding of their needs and collected comments, suggestions and requests. For some time now, we had the idea for the new tool reflecting our insights but we were waiting for the right moment.

So with the start of 2020 when we entered the global lock down we understood that we are now at a special moment in history. It was a time of pause, an intimate encounter with ourselves, in our homes. A time of questions. What’s working and what’s not? What do we need to let go off and what do we want to invite into our lives?

This was the moment to bring Flow.

Our newest tool that offers a look at the in-betweens of life.

65 Photo cards introduce a range of nuances between highs and lows, movement and stillness, uncertainty and clarity. The new Layout cards offer structured processes and new facilitation options. Flow is all about well being and mindfulness. It’s about facing challenges and accepting realities

We hope you enjoy it, as much as we did creating it and that you will find a unique way to make it your own.

Photo cards

In the heart of the game are the Photo cards, expressing various themes in our life, The center of each card is a photograph. The image connects us to our stories, emotions and feelings. It’s an invitation to the world of metaphors, unlimited points of view and new perspectives.

At the bottom of each card you will find the topic title. It’s another layer of inspiration when an image connects with the word. The topics are divided into five different series, marked by their symbol on the bottom left of the card. Bottom right you will find the number of the topic page in the inspirational book.

Additionally you will find the How to Look-card which offers pointers on how to observe the photo and word on the Photo cards to go into a deeper dialogue with the card.

# Working with Flow

To those of you who are already familiar with us - Flow is based exactly on the same method as the one used in The Coaching Game, Punctum and Faces. Photo cards, Layout cards/charts and an inspirational book. As in all of our tools there are no right or wrong answers, there is no “interpretation” key. There are no rules. Everything is open to your interpretation, intuition, flow and your point of view.

You can also mix the Photo cards together with the cards of The Coaching Game and have one big deck of cards to explore all the varieties of life.

Flow can be played by yourself, in pairs or in groups. With your family, friends, work colleagues and clients. There is no age limit or preferred setting. Use it any time, when you want to engage in a deep conversation, when you want to explore new perspectives, open up to new possibilities and to break patterns.

We invite you to play, experiment and see how you can make it work for you. As a starting point we recommend the following steps, to give yourself and your participants an unforgettable experience. You may choose to work with the Layout cards (more information on page 8) or go freestyle. Just flow.

Pause - Start by stopping. To be present and aware of the moment. It can be by just taking a few deep breaths. When ready choose an issue in your life that you want to explore and write it down on the Focus card.

Expand - Spread the Photo cards face up or face down in front of you and choose intuitively the cards that are calling you. Once chosen we invite you to observe and explore the card, with a curiosity of a child. The How to Look card can support you in engaging in your dialogue with the card. See how the image and the word connect with your issue. You can broaden your dialog by going into the book to the topic page and see what awaits you there.

Focus - Once you feel that you explored the cards, it’s time to capture what was your most significant insight from the observation. You can record them on the Focus card.

Doing - Don’t forget to write down a simple action or actions that will allow you to move your insight into your life.

This is just a small taste of what you can do with Flow. You are welcome to join our Points of You® Academy and deepen your understanding of the tool and it’s many possibilities. See how you can link it together with the other Points of You® tools, to create your own, unexpected experiences.

Flow is fun, light and deep, taking us into the nuances of life. Good Luck and enjoy the journey...

# From Layout Charts to Layout cards

To those of you who are already familiar with us in each of the previous tools you could find Layout Charts for a guided process. In Flow we present Layout cards. They work exactly the same as a Layout Chart. Additionally we are gaining the flexibility of mixing and matching the cards giving endless possibilities of playing with Flow.

How to Work with Layout cards

The Layout cards are designed to guide you through a process. To explore any issue that you want to observe. There are two ways you can work with the Layout cards:

A: You can choose one of the four designed processes (pg. 10-11 ) Choose the issue that you want to observe or gain new perspectives about. Choose the process that suits your interest best. Place the Layout cards face up in front of you. Choose three Photo cards, face up or face down*. Place one Photo card next to each Layout card. Go over each question separately and observe the card that you chose. Use the book to expand your perspective about each topic. See how they link with your issue. When you feel the question is answered move to the next one.

When you answered all the questions, look again at your chosen cards, see how do they link together? Is there any theme that is

appearing? What is the link between this and your issue.

Once finished take a photo of your process, for future reference it might come in handy. Note your insights from the process and planned actions.

B: Mix & Match.

The process itself will be the same as described earlier. Instead of choosing a defined process, you can intuitively create your own process by picking the Layout cards face up or face down. Choose from 3 to 5 cards. The Blank Layout cards come in handy if you want to ask your own questions. When working with the Layout cards face down, keep the element of surprise by uncovering the question only when you are ready to answer it.

If you are working with someone through a process, remember to be their guide in their journey. Be curious about the cards they picked and what they see in them.

*There are two ways of working with the cards. You can choose them face up (you see the photo) or face down (cards are covered).

Both ways create an interesting dynamic. Working with cards face up, lets you observe the process of choosing, while working

with face down cards enables you to let go of control and adds an element of surprise.

Check Up Process	Mix and Match

# Check Up

This process is an invitation to do a check up with your inner self. Take a few minutes to check if you are in alignment with where you are heading.

# Making a Shift

Feelings of unease or discomfort motivate us to seek change. Dissatisfaction is actually a great starting point. Use this process to check where your longing is coming from and what inner strengths will help you to take your next big leap.

# What do I want?

Use this process to listen to your inner voice, express your true wishes and find your commitment to achieving them.

# Finally

Use this process when you are looking for closure. Take time to reflect on a journey, a year, a project, a venture or a relationship that has come to an end. Close the door that needs to be closed and move forward.

# About the Series

The Photo cards are divided into five series which offer an additional dimension to the understanding of each card. Each series tells a story which sheds light on the topic of the card. Notice which series cards come to you, they bring a new layer to your process.

Dream

The moments when we express ourselves to the max.

This series represents the times in our lives where we are open to new possibilities. When there are no limits and we can let our

creativity go wild. It’s the moments when we have a vision in front of us and this inside hunger, for more. We are committed until we make it.

In Between

The moments when life actually happens

This series represents when we are between action and action. It’s these delicate moments that we want to capture. We live not in the doing but in the in between. To be open to the unknown. The

integration is in us, between one moment and the next. Being gentle and enjoying the path not the outcome.

Conflict

The uncomfortable moments of life which take us to the next level.

This series represents the times when we are in disagreement. When there is a clash of ideas and boundaries are being tested. It’s inconvenient, but these moments take us to the next step. To avoid conflicts is to avoid life itself. The real conflict is inside of us, the question is do we allow ourselves to put it out?

Belonging

The moments of life when we are connected.

This series invites us to all the places where we are welcome and accepted for who we are. It drives us to be a human being, to observe where we have connections and where we are longing for more. Do we allow ourselves to be authentic among others? It’s about finding your roots, your grounding in being you.

Presence

The moments of life when we allow ourselves to be.

This series represents the awareness of being in a state of existence. When we are in the rhythm of life but not reacting to it. Feeling with all our senses, being in the now. It’s finding the stillness in us when we allow ourselves to be with our mind, body and soul.

Dream Series

There was once a blind man who was married but had no children. One day as the blind man was sitting by a river, the prophet Elijah came to him from heaven and said, “Even though your life has been hard, you never complained, and so God will grant you one wish.” The poor man frowned. “Only one wish!” he said. “I’m blind, I’m poor, and I’m childless. How will one wish satisfy all my problems? But give me twenty-four hours and I’ll think up a wish.” He went home and told his wife what had happened. She smiled at him and said, “Eat well and sleep soundly, for I know what you should wish.” He came back the next morning and said to Elijah as he appeared again, “I wish to be able to see my children eat from gold plates.”

On Saturday,

he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone,

one pickle,

one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami,

one lollipop,

one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake,

and one slice of watermelon. That night he had a stomach ache. The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one nice leaf,

and after that, he felt better.Now he wasn’t hungry anymore-and he wasn’t a little caterpillar anymore. He was a big fat caterpillar. He built a small house,

called a cocoon, around himself. He stayed inside for more than two weeks.

Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and... He became a beautiful butterfly!

$2,000, and the third parrot costs $5,000.

Man: That’s interesting, but why are they so expensive? Shopkeeper: The first parrot can speak many languages and even knows about the Windows operating system.

Man: Wow. What about the second parrot?

Shopkeeper: Well, he also knows many languages, plus he knows some things about Windows and the Linux operating systems.

Man: That’s amazing! What about the third one? Why does he cost

$5,000? Which languages does he know?

Shopkeeper: Well, frankly speaking, he just fires bad words and doesn’t know anything, but the other two parrots call him BOSS! Joke

Oscar Wilde

What do I have?

Right now, what does not satisfy me in my life? What am I lacking that will give me satisfaction?

# Expectations

Dream Series

The other night I was talking to an extremely wise man. We spoke about love, about disappointments, and also about cats. I told him that what I like most and admire about cats – and a little bit about myself too – is that no matter how deep their fall is – they always land on their feet, flash their arrogantly indifferent feline smile, and keep going as if nothing happened, nobody fell down – especially not them.

This very wise man was silent for a moment, and then he told me that I’ve got it all wrong: cats only act as if they are not hurt. True, they always land on their feet – but in fact, they hit their back and shatter to pieces every single time. Nonetheless, cats being cats, are aware of their image, and they know they are expected to land on their feet every single time, so they hide the truth from everyone.

Thankfully, the man could not see my face that night. Otherwise he would have been able to see my eyes and to see that I was shattered to pieces, scattered across the floor.

Vered Mosenzon

People look to time in expectation that it will eventually make them happy, but you cannot find true happiness by looking toward the future.

What are my expectations towards myself? How can I be less disappointed?

# Intention

Dream Series

The promise of sunlight. But there is only rain.

The promise of warmth. But there is only coldness. The promise of laughter. But there is only silence. Rain pours, storms roar, Rivers run wild,

Sandals stay in and raincoats come out.

This is July, and the inevitable summer washout days are here. The ones with the power to dampen even the brightest of spirits. But we can fight the feelings it forces us to feel.

We can make the most out of the rainy days and wait for the flurry of wildflowers.

And while we wait,

Dancing in the rain is never a bad idea.

Katy Who, Seasons of Magic

# Unique

Dream Series

It was late, and Barak was in a hurry to catch the last bus home. Concerned he might miss it, he walked briskly to the bus stop. “What if I miss the bus,” he thought to himself. “Where will I spend the night?”

Crossing the street, he saw a man in a wheelchair. “Excuse me, sir?” The man turned to Barak. “Can you please take me to the no. 45 bus stop?” Barak checked his watch. He had 30 seconds left. Pondering for a second, he knew there was no other way. He began wheeling the man toward the bus stop as he saw the bus approaching. “Run to it.” said the man. Barak ran to the bus. Catching the bus and his breath, he said to the driver, “Please wait a moment, a man in a wheelchair needs to get on as well.” The mustached driver looked

at Barak and said, “I’m not waiting for anyone. Do you want to get on?” Barak looked back.

The man in the wheelchair signaled, suggesting he should get on the bus. “No. I’m not leaving him behind.” The driver, not giving it another thought, closed the doors and drove off. Barak walked

back to the man in the wheelchair. Not knowing what to do, he pushed the chair around the bus stop. Out of nowhere, another bus appeared from down the road. “Do you want to hop on?” the driver asked. “Of course!” replied Barak, delighted. “I thought the other bus was the last for the night.” “I thought so too, until I saw you from my window,”, said the driver. “Then, I realized that it was not the last, because I came to pick up those who care.”

# Resilience

Dream Series

A few months into the reign of a young king troubles began; drought, diseases and an enemy conquest, killing and imprisoning many. The young king escaped and sought refuge in a neighboring state where his friend was the ruler. I must have bad luck, he thought, I lost everything, this never happened in my family.

When he reached his friend, he asked for help. After careful thought his friend offered him a herd of 100 sheep. The young king scoffed at this “friendly” attitude. He had hoped for much more, he was a king not a shepherd, but still he accepted the offer.

Not much time passed and his herd was attacked by wolves. He ran away while his sheep got killed. He returned to his friend to ask for another favor. This time he received only 50 sheep. Again, his herd got killed and again, he received help but only 25 sheep. The young king got worried, if something happened again, the number would be halved again. He started taking care of his herd, it’s conditions and safety. He even started talking to his sheep. In no time the herd grew to 1000 sheep.

Delighted with this, he returned to his friend who was very happy with the news and offered him a whole state to rule. The young king, who by now was disillusioned with his friend, asked him “Why didn’t you give me a state right away if you had one too?”

The friend responded. “Well, since I have seen what has happened with your kingdom I was waiting for you to learn how to manage and lead others.”

# Light

Dream Series

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be

brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

Nelson Mandela, 1984

We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.

Plato

Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.

Helen Keller

To confront a person with his own shadow is to show him his own light.

Carl Jung

I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.

Og Mandino

And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.

Genesis 1: 3-4

How does light affect my life?

When does the light get too bright for me? Where is it still dark?

What shadow does my light cast?

# Commitment

Dream Series

There were two warring tribes in the Andes, one that lived in the lowlands and the other high in the mountains. The mountain people invaded the lowlanders one day, and as part of their plundering of the people, they kidnapped a baby of one of the lowlander families and took the infant with them back up into the mountains.

The lowlanders didn’t know how to climb the mountain. They didn’t know any of the trails that the mountain people used, and they didn’t know where to find the mountain people or how to track them in the steep terrain. Even so, they sent out their best party of fighting men to climb the mountain and bring the baby home.

The men tried first one method of climbing and then another. They tried one trail and then another. After several days of effort, however, they had climbed only a couple of hundred feet. Feeling hopeless and helpless, the lowlander men decided that the cause

was lost, and they prepared to return to their village below. As they were packing their gear for the descent, they saw the baby’s mother walking toward them. They realized that she was coming down the mountain which they hadn’t figured out how to climb.

And then they saw that she had the baby strapped to her back. How could that be? One man greeted her and said, “We couldn’t climb this mountain. How did you do this when we, the strongest and most able men in the village, couldn’t do it?”

She shrugged her shoulders and said, “It wasn’t your baby.”

# Heaven

Dream Series

An old man and his dog were walking along a country road, after they were actually dead. They came to a high, white stone wall along the side of the road. When they were close enough, he called out, “Excuse me, is this heaven?” “Yes, it is, Sir,” a man answered. “Would you happen to have some water?” he asked. “Of course, Sir. Come right in.” “I assume my friend can come in too?” he asked. “I’m sorry, Sir, but we don’t accept pets.” The man turned back toward the road, and continued in the direction he had been. He reached the top of another long hill.

“Excuse me!” he called. “Do you have any water?” “Certainly, there’s a pump over there,” a man said, pointing to a place that couldn’t be seen from outside the gate. “Come on in and make yourself at home.” “How about my friend here?” the traveler gestured towards the dog. “He’s welcome too” he said. They walked through the gate and after the man filled the bowl for his dog, he took a long drink himself. When both were satisfied, he and the dog walked back toward the man, and asked, “What do you call this place?” “This is heaven,” was the answer.

“Well, that’s confusing,” the traveler said. “There’s another man down the road who said that place was heaven.” “Nope. That’s hell.” “Doesn’t it offend you for them to use the name of heaven like that?” “No. It actually saves us a lot of time. They screen out the people who are willing to leave their best friends behind.”

Zen story

Heaven is not a place; it is a state of consciousness.

# Luck

Dream Series

An old Chinese farmer had a mare that broke through the fence and ran away. When his neighbors learned of it, they came to the farmer and said, “What bad luck this is. You don’t have a horse during planting season.” The farmer listened and then replied, “Bad luck, good luck. Who knows?”

A few days later, the mare returned with two stallions. When the neighbors learned of it, they visited the farmer. “You are now a rich man. What good fortune this is,” they said. The farmer listened and again replied, “Good fortune, bad fortune. Who knows?”

Later that day, the farmer’s only son was thrown from one of the stallions and broke his leg. When the neighbors heard about it, they came to the farmer. “It is planting season and now there is no one to help you,” they said. “This is truly bad luck.” The farmer listened, and once more he said, “Bad luck, good luck. Who knows?”

The very next day, the emperor’s army rode into the town and conscripted the eldest son in every family. Only the farmer’s son with his broken leg remained behind. Soon the neighbors arrived. Tearfully, they said, “Yours is the only son who was not taken from his family and sent to war. What good fortune this is...”

There is an Eastern tale which speaks of a very rich magician who had a great many sheep. But at the same time this magician was very mean. He did not want to hire shepherds, nor did he want to erect

a fence about the pasture where his sheep were grazing. The sheep consequently often wandered into the forest, fell into ravines, and so on, and above all they ran away, for they knew that the magician wanted their flesh and skins, and this they did not like.

At last the magician found a remedy. He hypnotized his sheep and suggested to them first of all that they were immortal, and that no harm was being done to them when they were skinned, that, on the contrary, it would be very good for them and even pleasant; secondly he suggested that the magician was a good master who loved his flock so much that he was ready to do anything in the world for them; and in the third place he suggested to them that if anything at all were going to happen to them, it was not going to happen just then, at any rate not that day and therefore they had no need to think about it. Further the magician suggested to his sheep

that they were not sheep at all; to some he suggested that they were lions, to others that they were eagles, to others that they were men, to others that they were magicians.

And after this, all cares and worries about the sheep came to an end. They never ran away again, but quietly awaited the time when the magician would require their flesh and skins.

# Curiosity

Inbetween Series

A seeker has heard that the wisest guru in all of India lives atop India’s highest mountain. So the seeker treks over hill and Delhi until he reaches the fabled mountain. It’s incredibly steep, and more than once he slips and falls. By the time he reaches the top he is full of cuts and bruises, but there is the guru, sitting cross legged in front of his cave.

“Oh wise guru,”, the seeker says, “Tell me what is the meaning of life?”

“Ah yes the secret of life” the guru says scratching his chin. “The secret of life is a teacup.”

“A teacup? I came all the way up here to ask you what the secret of life is and you tell me it’s a teacup?”

The guru shrugs “So maybe it isn’t a teacup.”

Theodore Geisel, best known as Dr. Seuss, wrote The Cat in the Hat after an editor challenged him to write a book that would use 250 of the 400 words that beginning readers should know. Well, the good doctor came very close, using 220. Later, the publisher Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn’t write a book using only fifty words. He could!

You know the children’s favorite that resulted as Green Eggs and Ham.

# Shift

Inbetween Series

One evening as Shichiri Kojun was reciting sutras, a thief with a sharp sword entered, demanding either his money or his life.

Shichiri told him: ‘Do not disturb me. You can find the money in that drawer.’ Then he resumed his recitation. A little while afterwards he stopped and called: ‘Don’t take it all. I need some to pay taxes tomorrow.’ The intruder gathered up most of the money and started to leave. ‘Thank a person when you receive a gift,’ Shichiri added.

The man thanked him and made off. A few days afterwards the fellow was caught and confessed, among others, to the offense against Shichiri. When Shichiri was called in as a witness he said: ‘This man is no thief, at least as far as I am concerned. I gave him the money and he thanked me for it.’ After the man finished his prison term, he went to Shichiri and became his disciple.

# Bridge

Inbetween Series

Once upon a time, two brothers who lived on adjoining farms fell into conflict. Their long collaboration fell apart. It exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence.

One morning there was a knock on the older brother’s door.

He opened it to find a man with a carpenter’s toolbox. “Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there?” the man asked. “Yes,” said the older brother. “Look across the creek at that farm. That’s

my neighbor, it’s my younger brother. See that pile of lumber curing by the barn? I want you to build me a fence, so I won’t need to see his place anymore.” The carpenter said, “I think I understand the situation. Show me the nails and the post-hole digger and I’ll be able to do a job that pleases you.” The carpenter worked hard all that day, measuring, sawing, nailing. At sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer’s eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge.

The neighbor, his younger brother, was coming across, his hand outstretched. “You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I’ve said and done.”

The two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other’s hand.They turned to see the carpenter hoist his toolbox on his shoulder. “No, wait! Stay a few

days” said the older brother. “I’d love to stay on,” the carpenter said, “but, I have many more bridges to build.”

# Flexibility

Inbetween Series

An elderly retired man was bothered by noisy boys playing outside the window of his small, first-floor apartment. Did he yell at them to go away? No. That wouldn’t have been smart. He went outside and said he loved hearing boys play and that he would give them each a quarter to play under his window. The boys were delighted. He paid them a quarter every day for a week.

The second week he came out after they had been playing and explained that because he was very poor, he could only afford a dime for each of them. The boys didn’t like the reduction in their wage. Several left, but most of them stayed. At the beginning of the third week, the retired man came out and explained that he was so poor he could afford only a penny for each of them each day. The boys left, saying they wouldn’t play near his window for pennies. Folktale

# Playfulness

Inbetween Series

One time Robert took his five year old daughter Claudia to the park. When they reached the park Claudia started playing on the toy bike while Robert sat on a bench nearby and observed his daughter.

After some time, Robert called his daughter. “Claudia, Shall we go now?”. Claudia pleaded, “No, Just five more minutes, Dad. Please?.” Robert nodded and Claudia continued to ride her bike to her heart’s content.

Fifteen minutes passed, Robert called again. “Come on Claudia, It’s time to go now.” Claudia again pleaded, “Five more minutes, Dad….. just five more minutes.” Robert agreed, his eyes were filled with happiness.

After 15 minutes or so, the same thing happened again, Robert called Claudia and she pleaded to be allowed to play for a few more minutes. Again, Robert agreed to let her play.

A woman sitting next to Robert was observing all this and was quite surprised. She said, “You are a patient father, I appreciate how you accommodate your daughter’s request again and again with a smiling face. If I were in your shoes, I would have certainly got annoyed.” Robert smiled and replied, “Her older brother was killed last year while he was coming back home. I never spent much time with him and now I would give anything to spending just five more minutes with him. I’ve vowed not to make the same mistake with Claudia. She thinks she has five more minutes to ride her bike. The truth is, I get five more minutes to watch her play.”

# Movement

Inbetween Series

The Hippie Movement began in the 1960s and was very influential on American politics, law and everyday life. This was a time where predominantly the youth started reflecting on social values. A new counterculture was forming and those involved were not afraid of what people thought of them. Their ideas on all things political, social, cultural and every day values were completely different to what Americans had seen before. Hippies focused more on cultural values in life rather than political issues, even though politics played a big part in their, “Make Love, Not War” slogan. They were antiwar and promoted peace and love as an answer to all things. They gained a lot of public attention. The biggest issues society had with them were their public protests, meetings and discussions that would flood the streets. Many hippies dropped out of school and followed their own paths of self-discovery, with the use of drugs, sex and rock n roll which were seen as natural and spiritual. They referred to the regular, American citizens as “squares” - People who follow rules and standards that have been placed upon Everyone, like the average nine to five job and the stresses that come along with it. The hippies were easy to identify because of the way they looked, dressing outside of social norms. For example, male hippies wore very long hair and beards. They lived in communes together and would frequently move out into the woods to become one with nature. The hippie movement laid an image on the 1960s and 1970s on youth and American culture. The movement landed in history textbooks for generations to talk about.

# On the Edge

Inbetween Series

A big, tough samurai once went to see a little monk.

“Monk!” He barked, in a voice accustomed to instant obedience. “Teach me about heaven and hell!”

The monk looked up at the mighty warrior and replied with utter disdain,

“Teach you about heaven and hell? I couldn’t teach you about anything. You’re dumb. You’re dirty. You’re a disgrace, an embarrassment to the samurai class. Get out of my sight. I can’t stand you.”

The samurai got furious. He shook, red in the face, speechless with rage. He pulled out his sword, and prepared to slay the monk.

Looking straight into the samurai’s eyes, the monk said softly, “That’s hell.”

The samurai froze, realizing the compassion of the monk who had risked his life to show him hell! He put down his sword and fell to his knees, filled with gratitude.

The monk said softly, “And that’s heaven.”

The Little Monk and the Samurai: A Zen Parable

We’re in such a hurry most of the time we never get much chance to talk. The result is a kind of endless day-to-day shallowness, a monotony that leaves a person wondering years later where all the time went and sorry that it’s all gone.

# Lightness

Inbetween Series

There were two little boys playing on a frozen lake and despite the warning signs of thin ice, one boy fell through and was trapped and couldn’t get out.

His friend was trying to save him, but he couldn’t. He could see him through the thin ice, but he couldn’t help him... So he ran to the nearest tree, climbed it, and broke off an enormous branch. Then, he ran back to his friend and started breaking the ice with the branch and finally managed to pull him out of the water.

When the paramedics came, they were baffled as to how this young little boy could rip off such an enormous branch, and THEN break the ice with it to help his friend. They just couldn’t see how it was possible.

Then an elderly man who was there said: I know how he did it. They asked him how.

The man said: “There was no one here to tell him he couldn’t do it.”

# Everything is OK

Inbetween Series

In October 2013, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Our topic of the month at Points of You® was “unexpected” and along those exact same lines, I found myself constantly hearing and saying that very imprecise phrase, everything’s okay.

Is everything okay? Everything will be okay! Everything’s fine, dear. Things will be fine. I’m okay!!! And during it all, things were as far from fine as they could be. Even being asked if everything’s okay was irritating.

However, after the first shock of the illness, I suddenly understood that “everything’s okay” is a state of mind that allows me - and other people too, even if for only a second - to feel and believe that things really and truly are alright. This realization made it possible for me to put all those unexpected, nagging feelings and fears aside for a moment. It helped me to feel and believe that everything really is fine!

Thank heavens, everything’s fine. As I write this, I am two weeks post surgery and in the process of healing, and it’s good to know that everything’s fine :) I hope that everything’s fine with you too...

Efrat Shani, 2014

# Conflict

Conflict Series

One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people.

“My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us all. One is Evil – It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other is Good – It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.”

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather:

“Which wolf wins?”

“The one you feed,” the old man replied.

Conflict Series

A long time ago, there lived a gifted musician named Orpheus. Orpheus was the son of  and Calliope (the muse of poetry).

With such talented parents, it was no wonder that Orpheus was a gifted musician. The truth was, Orpheus was more than gifted.

His music was magical. When he played the lyre, as his father had taught him, his songs could cast spells and soothe savage beasts. Orpheus loved his wife, a mortal, Eurydice. When she died, he traveled down into the Underworld. He begged his great uncle Hades to allow his wife to come back to earth. Hades agreed, under one condition. Hades agreed to let Eurydice follow her husband back to earth and life. But, during the trip, Orpheus had to promise not to look back until both he and his wife were safely back on earth.

Orpheus was worried. He was afraid that perhaps his wife might need his help - it was a very scary trip back to the surface. He worried that perhaps Hades would not send her after all. To reassure himself that all was fine, he risked a quick look behind him, and lost his wife forever.

Orpheus, Greek myth

Relationships are like a dance, with visible energy racing back and forth between partners. Some relationships are the slow, dark dance of death.

So I go back and forth forever. All my thoughts, they come in pairs.

Conor Oberst , Another Travelin’ Song’

Looking at the past is like lolling in a rocking chair. It is so relaxing and you can rock back and forth on the porch, and never go forward.

In what area of my life I’m going back and forth with? Is it “good” or “bad” to go back and forth?

What decision should I make?

# Boundaries

Conflict Series

Once upon a time there lived a man who was wise, well known and very rich. One day the man’s wife died. His children came to him and said that it was a shame to live alone in such a big house. Sell the house and your fields, give us the money, and you can live with your oldest son, and we will take care of all your needs. The man agreed, sold everything he had, divided up all his wealth among his children, and went to live in the home of his oldest son. Gradually the children and grandchildren stopped coming to visit, and in his oldest son’s house they turned against him. One day, the man said to his oldest son, call the mayor and gather all your brothers and sisters, I have something important to give you. When everyone was assembled, the man said to them: look, I have one large suitcase full of money, gold and diamonds. The suitcase is buried under the big tree at the entrance to our town, and it is locked with two padlocks. Only the two keys together can open the suitcase. Here is one key that I’m giving to you, Mr. Mayor, and I give the other key to you, my oldest son. From that day on, the man’s situation improved incomparably and he returned to his former state. One day, he died, and all his sons and daughters went with the mayor to the tree at

the entrance to town. They dug and dug until they found the large suitcase. When they opened the suitcase, they found a head of a donkey and a letter. The letter, in the man’s handwriting, read: “Only a donkey gives away everything he has in his lifetime”.

The point is, not to resist the flow.

You go up when you’re supposed to go up and down when you’re supposed to go down. When you’re supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top.

When you’re supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom.

When there’s no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up.

If everything dries up, the world is darkness.

# Denial

Conflict Series

The Me Too (or #MeToo) movement, with variations of related local or international names, is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual abuse where people publicize their allegations of sex crimes committed by powerful and/or prominent men.The phrase “Me Too” was initially used in this context on social media in 2006, on Myspace, by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke.

The original purpose of “Me Too” as used by Tarana Burke in 2006 was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.

Wikipedia

Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.

George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones

Denial of one’s need for others is the most common type of defense against bonding. If people come from a situation, whether growing up or later in life, where good, safe relationships were not available to them, they learn to deny that they even want them. Why want what you can’t have? They slowly get rid of their awareness of the need.

# Comparison

Conflict Series

A noble and honest Samurai went to visit a Zen monk to ask him for his advice. When he reached the monk the Samurai asked, “Why do I feel so inferior? I have faced death many times, defended those who are weak. Nevertheless, upon seeing you meditating, I felt that my life had absolutely no importance whatsoever.”

“Wait. Once I have attended to all those who come to see me today, I shall answer you.” replied the monk

The samurai spent the whole day,watching the people go in and out in search of advice. He saw how the monk received them all. At nightfall, when everyone had gone, he demanded: “Now can you teach me?” The master led him to his room. The full moon shone in the sky, and the atmosphere was one of profound tranquility.

“Do you see the moon, how beautiful it is? It will cross the sky, and tomorrow the sun will shine once again. But sunlight is much

brighter, and can show the details of the landscape around us: trees, mountains, clouds. I never heard the moon say: ‘why do I not shine like the sun? Is it because I am inferior?’”

“Of course not,” answered the samurai. “The moon and the sun are different things, each has its own beauty. You cannot compare the two.”

“So you know the answer. “We are two different people, each fighting in his own way for that which he believes, and making the world a better place; the rest are mere appearances.”

When he walked into the house, the Master greeted him with a question.

“Tell me, did you leave your sandals and umbrella on the porch?” “Yes,” replied the Teacher.

“And tell me,” the Master continued, “Did you leave your umbrella to the left or to the right of your sandals?”

The Teacher realized he did not know the answer, and that he had not yet attained full awareness. He stayed and studied with the Master for ten more years.

# Doubt

Conflict Series

The Zen master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one living a pure life. A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near him. Suddenly, without any warning, her parents discovered she was pregnant.

This made her parents very angry. She would not confess who the man was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.

In great anger, the parents went to the master. “Is that so?” was all he would say.

When the child was born, the parents brought it to Hakuin, who now was viewed as a pariah by the whole village. They demanded that he take care of the child since it was his responsibility. “Is that so?” Hakuin said calmly as he accepted the child.

A year later the girl-mother could stand it no longer.

She told her parents the truth – that the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fish market.

The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask his forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back again. Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child, all he said was: “Is that so?”

# Shame

Conflict Series

Shame is the most powerful, master emotion. It’s the fear that we’re not good enough.

There are three things I know about shame:

Everyone has it.

Everyone is scared to talk about it.

The less we talk about shame, the more control it has over our lives.

Brene Brown, Daring Greatly

Shame is always easier to handle if you have someone to share it with.

Where there is no shame, there is no honor.

Martin Opitz

Your shame hides in many places-in anger, blame, denial, workaholism, perfectionism, drinking, and anything else you compulsively engage in to make yourself feel better. But if you could just learn to be vulnerable for one second, and open up to the pain, you would find there’s no place left for your shame to hide.

Adam Appleson

What would it be like if I were free of shame? Who’s shame am I carrying?

# Obvious

Conflict Series

A business executive was deep in debt and could see no way out. He sat on the park bench, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy. Suddenly an old man appeared before him. “I can see that something is troubling you,” he said. After listening to the executive’s woes, the old man said, “I believe I can help you.” He wrote out a check, “Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time. ”The business executive saw in his hand a check for $500,000. John

D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world signed it! “I can erase my money worries in an instant!” he realized. Instead, the executive decided to put the un-cashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought. With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the un-cashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. “I’m so glad I caught him! He’s always escaping from the rest home and telling people he’s John D. Rockefeller.” Suddenly, the man realized that it wasn’t the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his new- found self confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he ever imagined.

# Arrogance

Conflict Series

The Prime Minister of the Tang Dynasty was a national hero for his success as both a political leader and military leader. However, despite his fame, power, and wealth, he considered himself a humble and devout Buddhist. Often he visited his favorite Zen master to study under him, and they seemed to get along very well. The fact that he was prime minister apparently had no effect on their relationship, which seemed to be simply one of a revered master and respectful student.

One day, during his usual visit, the Prime Minister asked the master, “Your Reverence, what is arrogance according to Buddhism?” The master’s face turned red, and in a very condescending and insulting tone of voice, he shot back, “What kind of stupid question is that!?” This unexpected response so shocked the Prime Minister that he became sullen and angry. The Zen master then smiled and said, “THIS, Your Excellency, is arrogance.”

Belonging Series

A few years ago, at the Seattle Special Olympics, nine contestants, all physically or mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash. At the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish to run the race to the finish and win.

All, that is, except one little boy who stumbled on the asphalt, tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other eight heard the boy cry. They slowed down and looked back. Then they all turned around and went back. Every one of them.

One girl with Down’s Syndrome bent down and kissed him and said: “This will make it better.”

Then all nine linked arms and walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood, and the cheering went on for several minutes.

# Transparency

Belonging Series

Once upon a time there was an emperor whose only interest in life was to dress up in fashionable clothes. He kept changing his clothes so that people could admire him. Once, two thieves decided to teach him a lesson. They told the emperor that they were very fine tailors and could sew a lovely new suit for him. It would be so light and fine that it would seem invisible. Only those who were stupid could not see it. The emperor was very excited and ordered the

new tailors to begin their work. One day, the king asked the prime minister to go and see how much work the two tailors had done. He saw the two men moving scissors in the air but he could see no cloth! He kept quiet for fear of being called stupid and ignorant.

Instead, he praised the fabric and said it was marvelous.

Finally, the emperor’s new dress was ready. He could see nothing but he too did not want to appear stupid. He admired the dress and thanked the tailors. He was asked to parade down the street for all to see the new clothes. The emperor paraded down the main street. The people could only see a naked emperor but no one admitted it for fear of being thought stupid.

They foolishly praised the invisible fabric and the colors. The emperor was very happy. At last, a child cried out, “The emperor is naked!” Soon everyone began to murmur the same thing and very soon all shouted, “The emperor is not wearing anything!”

The emperor realized the truth but preferred to believe that his people were stupid.

“well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting. Come, Boy, sit down.

Sit down and rest.” And the boy did.

There was once a King who had one eye and one leg..

He asked all the painters to draw a beautiful portrait of him. But none of them could -- how could they paint him beautifully with his defects, with one eye and one leg.

Eventually one of the painters agreed and drew a classic picture of the King.

It was a fantastic picture that surprised everyone..

The painter made a portrait in which the king was sitting on the horse, on the one-leg side, holding his bow and aiming the arrow with his one eye closed…

# Oneness

Belonging Series

Everything in the universe is connected. We are all one. But our daily habits can separate us from oneness. Follow these steps to achieve oneness.

See Your Own Oneness-

When you stand in front of a mirror, pause for a moment, and look directly into your eyes. Say silently or aloud AHUM BRAHMASMI (a hum brah mass me), which means I am the Universe or I am

the totality. You can say it in English if you prefer. This is your soul reflecting back into itself and reminding itself of its Oneness. Practice this at least once a day or whenever you catch your reflection in a mirror.

Namaste-

The Indian blessing Namaste (nam ass tay) is accompanied by bringing the palms together in front of the heart center, when meeting or taking leave of someone. It means, “I recognize the Divinity in you which is also the Divinity in me” or in other words, “We are the same Oneness.” If it’s not comfortable for you to say it aloud, think it silently every time you meet someone.

Roger Gabriel (Raghavanand), Deepak Chopra Center

If you can see God (the Oneness) in everyone, you can never do harm to anyone.

# Serenity

Belonging Series

A little while ago my sixteen-year-old niece sent me a long email. The gist of it was, “Life sucks. I see my dad coming home from work every day totally bummed out. I don’t want to get trapped in the

rat race, but I don’t see any hope of avoiding it. Is this what life is about? What’s the point? I might as well just shoot myself and die.”

“Christina,” I wrote back, “you might not think this is a great response but I’m proud of you. I can’t tell you that you are going to solve your dilemma and find The Answer. I know you want answers- but sometimes life doesn’t provide them right away. But you are asking the right questions, and that is important.”

In quietness are all things answered.

# Friendship

Belonging Series

A voyaging ship was wrecked during a storm at sea and only two of the men were able to swim to a small, desert-like island. The two survivors who have been good friends, not knowing what else to do, agreed that they had no other recourse but to pray to God. However, to see whose prayer was more powerful, they agreed to divide the territory between them and stay on opposite sides of the island.

The first man prayed for food, a house, clothes and a wife. The next day, like magic, all of these were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.

Then, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife could leave the island. In the morning, he found a ship docked at his side of the island. The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to leave the second man on the island. He considered the other man unworthy to receive God’s blessings, since none of his

prayers had been answered. As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from heaven booming, “Why are you leaving your companion on the island?”

“My blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them,” the first man answered.

“His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not deserve anything.”

“You are mistaken!” the voice rebuked. “He had only one prayer, which I answered. He prayed that all your prayers be answered.“ Legend

A friendless man is like a left hand without a right hand.

“My dear wife, I have just arrived. The journey was long, but it was worthwhile. Everything is wonderful - truly paradise! The trees, the gardens, the parties. Although I have only been here a few hours, I already feel at home. Now I am going to rest a while. I just wanted to tell you that I have already talked to people here, and everyone is waiting for you to arrive. I am certain that you will like the place. Prepare yourself; it is hot as hell here!

# Hug

Belonging Series

Once upon a time there was a bear, overflowing with love and happiness, who only wanted to spread the love. Whenever he came across another living being as he wandered through the forest,

he would hug it.

The bear was so invested in his desire to spread love that he didn’t really see or take any interest in the wishes of the other creature that he hugged, whether it was small or large, whether it liked being

hugged or not. He simply hugged. More than anything else, the bear loved to hug trees. Trees that might be bowed down by a bear hug, as well as those that could withstand it.

One day, the bear saw a man walking through the forest carrying an axe. The man looked long and hard at a splendid old tree, and then began to chop it down. For the first time in his life, the bear did not want to hug; instead he felt the need to attack.

At the last second the bear stopped himself. He decided that it was not in his nature to attack, and so he chose to do the best thing he knew how - to hug. The man was so startled that he ran for his life, and then the bear was free to do what he loved the most - he hugged the tree.

Nicholas Oldland, Big Bear Hug

# Family

Belonging Series

Once there were two brothers who inherited their father’s land. The brothers divided the land in half and each one farmed his own section. Over time, the older brother married and had six children, while the younger brother never married. One night, the younger brother lay awake. “It’s not fair that each of us has half the land

to farm,” he thought. “My brother has six children to feed and I have none. He should have more grain than I do.” So that night the younger brother went to his silo, gathered a large bundle of wheat, and climbed the hill that separated the two farms on his way to his

brother’s farm. He left the wheat in his brother’s silo. Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake. “In old age, my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, while

my brother will probably have no one. He should at least sell more grain from the fields now.” So that night, he too secretly gathered

a large bundle of wheat and left it in his brother’s silo. The next morning, each of the brothers was surprised to see the amount of grain in his barn unchanged.

The next night, each brother gathered a large pile of wheat from his barn, loaded it onto a cart, and slowly pulled his haul through the fields and up the hill to his brother’s barn. When each of the brothers recognized the form of the other brother and the load he was pulling behind, they realized what had happened. Without a word, they dropped the ropes to their carts and embraced.

# Home

Belonging Series

In the last months of his life, the painter Serge Valene came up with the idea of creating a single picture that would encompass his entire experience: it would contain everything ever registered in his memory, all the feelings he had ever had, all his dreams, his communication, all the tiny details making up his life.

The picture would show the Parisian apartment building in which he had lived for more than 55 years. The facade of the building would be removed and it would be possible to see a cross-section of all the rooms at the front of the building, the elevator shaft, the stairs, the front doors to the apartments. And like in those dollhouses in which everything is copied in miniature, the carpets, the etchings, the wall clocks, the samovars - in each room it would be possible to find the people who had lived there in the past and the people still living there, and all the details of their lives, their cats, their faces, their story...

Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince

What is happening now?

Does my presence depend on something or someone? What does “being present” give me?

# Patience

Presence Series

“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.

“I don’t much care where –” said Alice.

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

“– so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation. “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

You must first have a lot of patience to learn to have patience.

Stanisław Jerzy Lec

Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.

A.A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh

Patience is a necessary ingredient of genius.

Benjamin Disraeli

If patience is worth anything, it must endure to the end of time.

Mahatma Gandhi

Patience is the art of hoping.

Luc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues

Patience - A minor form of despair, disguised as a virtue.

Ambrose Bierce

Better late than never.

Danish quote

Where do I encounter my patience? And where do I not? How does it feel to be patient?

When was the last time I lost my patience?

# Vulnerability

There once lived a great warrior. Though quite old, he still was able to defeat any challenger. His reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him. One day an infamous young warrior arrived at the village.

He was determined to be the first man to defeat the great master. Along with his strength, he had an uncanny ability to spot and exploit any weakness in an opponent. He would wait for his opponent to make the first move, thus revealing a weakness, and then would strike with merciless force and lightning speed. No one had ever lasted with him in a match beyond the first move. Much against the advice of his concerned students, the old master gladly accepted the young warrior’s challenge. As the two squared off for battle, the young warrior began to hurl insults at the old master.

He threw dirt and spit in his face. For hours he verbally assaulted him with every curse and insult known to mankind. But the old warrior merely stood there motionless and calm. Finally, the young warrior exhausted himself. Knowing he was defeated, he left feeling shamed. Somewhat disappointed that he did not fight the insolent youth, the students gathered around the old master and questioned him. “How could you endure such an indignity? How did you drive him away?” “If someone comes to give you a gift and you do not receive it,” the master replied, “to whom does the gift belong?”

Zen story

Presence Series

Vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it’s also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love.

Brene Brown

Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain.

Bob Dylan

We’re never so vulnerable than when we trust someone - but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find love or joy. Frank Crane

And that visibility which makes us most vulnerable

is that which also is the source of our greatest strength.

Audre Lorde

Sometimes we must yield control to others

and accept our vulnerability so we can be healed.

Dr. Kathy Magliato

Why should I foster vulnerability in my relationships? How can vulnerability make my life better?

What stops me from embracing my own vulnerability?

# Surrender

Presence Series

A Sufi teaching story tells of a man who prayed continually for the awareness to succeed in life. Then one night he dreamed of going into the forest to attain understanding. The next morning he went into the woods and wandered for several hours looking for some sign that would provide answers. When he finally stopped to rest, he saw a fat fox with no legs lying between two rocks in a cool place. Curious as to how a legless fox could survive, he waited until sunset when he observed a lion come and lay meat before the fox.

“Ah, I understand,” the man thought. “The secret to success in life is to trust that God will take care of all my needs. I don’t need to provide for myself. All I have to do is totally surrender to my all- sustaining God.”

Two weeks later, weakened and starving, the man had another dream. In it he heard a voice say, “Fool. Be like the lion, not like the fox.”

Sufi Story

Always say yes to the present moment… Surrender to what is.

Say ‘yes’ to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you.

Eckhart Tolle

The creative process is a process of surrender, not control.

Julia Cameron

Sometimes, it’s not the times you decide to fight, but the times you decide to surrender, that makes all the difference.

Sissy Gavrilaki

I generally avoid temptation unless I can’t resist it.

Mae West

Surrender is not a weakness it is strength.It takes tremendous strength to surrender life to the supreme - to the cosmic unfolding. Mooji

To which things do I give up? Am I a submissive person?

If everything were possible, what would I give up to? To what do I want to surrender?

When I surrender… How does it feel?

# Precision

Presence Series

Sir Francis Galton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal’s weight after

it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, but not one person hit the exact mark: 1,198 pounds. Galton stated that “the middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters”, and calculated this value (in modern terminology, the median) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, he

acknowledged that the mean of the guesses, at 1,197 pounds, was even more accurate.

Wikipedia

A woman’s guess is much more accurate than a man’s certainty.

Rudyard Kipling

All of us, whether or not we are warriors, have a cubic centimeter of chance that pops out in front of our eyes from time to time. The difference between an average man and a warrior is that the warrior is aware of this, and one of his tasks is to be alert, deliberately waiting, so that when his cubic centimeter pops out he has the necessary speed, the prowess, to pick it up.

Carlos Castaneda

Your big opportunity may be right where you are now.

Napoleon Hill

Ninety percent of life is just showing up.

Woody Allen

Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything.

Wyatt Earp

How do I know I have been precise?

Where, in my life, is it important to me to be precise? Am I a perfectionist?

When is it better not to be precise?

# Silence

Presence Series

A group of people used to meet every evening to meditate in one of the monasteries in Kyoto. One evening, one of the participants arrived late; he did not have time to eat his evening meal. During meditation his stomach began to rumble so loudly that it could be heard throughout the room. The following day, before the start of meditation, one of the other participants turned to him and said, “I hope you have eaten this evening. Last night, the noise of your stomach was so loud that it was hard to concentrate.” “Yes, I have eaten this evening, and I have also made sure that the crickets will

be silent and the moon will not shine. This evening there will be no disturbances.”

Zen story

In silence there is eloquence.

Stop weaving and see how the pattern improves.

Rumi

Words like violence break the silence

Depeche Mode, Enjoy the Silence

Be silent or let thy words be worth more than silence.

Pythagoras

But my words like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence.

Paul Simon, The Sound of Silence

The saying is true “The empty vessel makes the greatest sound.”

William Shakespeare, Henry V

The true genius shudders at incompleteness — imperfection — and usually prefers silence to saying the something which is not everything that should be said.

Edgar Allan Poe, Marginalia

What is a moment of quiet for me?

When was the last time I listened to silence? Am I comfortable to be in silence with others?

# Rhythm

Presence Series

“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally get to somewhere else - if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.”

“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen.

“Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do,

to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”

Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass

To live is to be musical, starting with the blood dancing in your veins. Everything living has a rhythm. Do you feel your music?

Michael Jackson

Life is like dancing. If we have a big floor, many people will dance. Some will get angry when the rhythm changes. But life is changing all the time.

Don Miguel Ruiz

Dress me slowly, I’m in a hurry.

Napoleon Bonaparte

Some people will never learn anything, for this reason, because they understand everything too soon.

Alexander Pope

An artist must possess Nature. He must identify himself with her rhythm, by efforts that will prepare the mastery which will later enable him to express himself in his own language.

Henri Matisse

What is my inner beat or rhythm? What is the right rhythm for me? Is there such a thing?

Is the rhythm of my life really the personal tempo at which I want to live?

# Synchronization

Presence Series

A mouse was in constant distress because of its fear of the cat. A magician took pity on it and turned it into a cat. But then it became afraid of the dog.

So the magician turned it into a dog. Then it began to fear the panther, so the magician turned it into a panther. Whereupon it was full of fear for the hunter.

At this point, the magician gave up. He turned it into a mouse again saying, “Nothing I do for you is going to be of any help because you have the heart of a mouse.”

Indian fable

You have to try the impossible to achieve the possible.

Hermann Hesse

If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper. Down deep, the fish are more powerful and purer. They’re huge and abstract. And they’re very beautiful.

David Lynch

You receive from the world what you give to the world.

Arianna Huffington

Sometimes you are in sync with the times, sometimes you are in advance, sometimes you are late.

Bernardo Bertolucci

My personality resembles my designs to a large extent. I’m in sync with myself and I’m transparent, just like my designs.

Elie Saab

Is my daily life in sync with my goals and my dreams? What do I need to let go off in order to be synchronized? Is my life out of sync?

Am I in tune with the Universe?

How am I when I am not in synchronization?

# Breathing

When you breathe, your breathing is never natural. If you are a little angry, your anger changes your breathing. If you are full of passion, lust, your lust changes your breathing. If you are greedy, your greed is reflected in your breathing. Continuously your mind mood infiltrates breathing and changes it. You can watch it. When you are angry, try not to disturb the breathing, and you will be completely unable to be angry. Just try not to change the breathing. Let the breathing remain as it was before you became angry, and then try to be angry. It will be impossible. The breathing has to change first. Through the breathing the body changes; the mind first affects the breathing. When you are in a moment of lust, watch, keep the breathing natural, and you will suddenly find the lust has disappeared, the moment came and passed.

Osho, The First Principle

Presence Series

What we call ’I’ is just a swinging door, which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. It just moves; that is all.

Shunryu Suzuki

Everything we are, everything we feel and everything we believe is reflected through the breath.

Carol Lampman

With my last breath, I’ll exhale my love for you.

I hope it’s a cold day, so you can see what you meant to me.

Jarod Kintz

Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, which unites your body to your thoughts.

Thich Nhat Hanh

I wake up every day and I think, ‘I’m breathing! It’s a good day.’

Eve Ensler

How aware am I of my breathing?

When was the last time my breath stopped?

How often have I stopped and remembered that I forgot to breathe?

# Stability

Presence Series

“Look, one day I had gone to a little village. An old grandfather of ninety was busy planting an almond tree. ‘What, grandfather!’ I exclaimed. ‘Planting an almond tree?’ And he, bent as he was,

turned around and said: ‘My son, I carry on as if I should never die.’ I replied: ‘And I carry on as if I was going to die any minute.’ Which of us was right, boss?”.

Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek

A ship should not ride on a single anchor, nor life on a single hope.

Epictetus

Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.

Albert Einstein

You can’t have a relationship where one person says “I love you,” and the other one says “I’m hungry, let’s get something to eat.” Seinfeld

Truth often sacrificed for the sake of stability and peace.

Toba Beta

Doubts are more cruel than the worst of truths.

Molière

Every man has his folly, but the greatest folly of all... is not to have one.

Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek

On a scale of 1 to 10, how stable is my life? Whom do I see as a stable person?

Would I like more stability in my life? What is the most stable thing I have?

# Smile

Presence Series

I was to be killed. I searched my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes which had escaped their search. I found one but I had no matches. I looked through the bars at my jailer. He did not make eye contact with me. After all, one does not make eye contact with a corpse. I called out to him ‘Have you got a light please?’ He looked at me, shrugged and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the match, his eyes inadvertently locked with mine.

At that moment, I smiled. I don’t know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile... In that instant, a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn’t want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly and smiling. I kept smiling at him, now aware of him as a person and not just a jailer. And his looking at me seemed to have a new dimension, too. ‘Do you have children?’ he asked. ‘Yes.’ I took out my wallet and fumbled for the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his ninos and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes filled with tears. I said that I feared that I’d never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too. Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell and silently led me out...

Antoine de Saint-Exupery, “Le Sourire”

The smile is the shortest distance between two persons.

Victor Borge

Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought Alice ‘but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!

Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

Count your age by friends, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears.

John Lennon

The earth laughs in flowers.

E E Cummings

Everytime you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.

Mother Teresa

Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.

Dr. Seuss

I love the man that can smile in trouble.

Thomas Paine

When have I genuinely smiled?

How many times have I smiled today? What do I feel when people smile at me?

# Flow

Presence Series

Once upon a time there was a Shogun who wanted a nice picture of a chicken to go in his tokonoma. So, he went to a very fine artist and said, “I want you to paint me the best picture of a chicken that you can.”

So, the artist said, “Yes, yes, certainly, I will do this.”

The artist went to his cabin high on Mount Fuji. He brought books of bird anatomy, many studies of birds done by all the famous artists of the past, he sculpted chickens, he painted chickens in oil, he did one woodblock after another of nothing but chickens.

Ten years passed.

One day the Shogun was at archery practice when he thought of his request to the artist. He immediately mounted his steed and made his way to the artist’s cabin. It was hard to enter the door. There were sketches of chickens stacked to the ceiling. There were statues of chickens everywhere. There were skeletons of chickens and paintings of chickens. There was nowhere to sit and very little space to stand.

“Where is my chicken drawing?” demanded the Shogun.

“Oh,” said the artist, “I forgot, sorry.” And he took a brush, whirled it very quickly on a piece of rice paper, handed the paper to the Shogun, and said, “Here.”

Zen Story

Forget yourself. Become one with the universe and your music. Let it flow through you. No matter how perfect technically, if your expression is not natural and unselfconscious, your music won’t affect others emotionally but will merely be your subjective counterfeit.

Basho

One of my teachers once said that the way you know you’re on the right path is that it works.

James Redfield

Allowing the truth of who you are, your spiritual self, to rule your life means you stop the struggle and learn to move with the flow of your life.

Oprah Winfrey

It is when we act freely, for the sake of the action itself rather than for ulterior motives, that we learn to become more than what we were.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

When was the last time for me to be in flow? How do I recognize when I am in flow?

Is happiness and flow the same thing for me?

# Love in Action

Presence Series

Once upon a time, there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to write. One day, as he was walking along the shore, he noticed a young man who was reaching down to the shore, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean.

He came closer and called out “Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?” The young man paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean.” “I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?” asked the somewhat startled wise man. To this, the young man replied, “The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw them in, they’ll die.” Upon hearing this, the wise man commented, “But, young man, do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can’t possibly make a difference!”

At this, the young man bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it met the water, he said,

“I made a difference for that one.”

Loren C. Eiseley, Adapted from The Star Thrower

When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object.

Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness of Being

Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams.

,

Being in love, rather than giving or taking love, is the only thing that provides stability. Being in love means seeing the Beloved all around me.

I think we love differently every day. Like the guy who said you can’t stand in a river at exactly the same place twice. Today I love you differently than yesterday, or will tomorrow.

Jonathan Carroll

One small action of love can do far,

far more for a soul than all the most beautiful words in the world.

Eileen Caddy

What does “Love in Action” mean to me? How do I express “Love in Action” in my life?

Who is one person I see as a truly “Love in Action” person?

Taking a moment to reflect on our work and life routines from a different perspective. This pause 
allows for an intimate, authentic, and non-judgmental encounter with oneself and others.

In any situation, there are infinite perspectives. The real challenge is to see viewpoints different from 
those familiar to us and explore things from new angles.

ones, enabling us  to communicate in an authentic, precise, and fruitful way.

Formulating new and meaningful insights and defining practical actions for the future. 

Our trainings are not in lecture format but rather experiential processes that combine various activities.

Points of You® Training Basics

Table of Contents  >

The Difference Between Points of You®  
Facilitation and Training

At Points of You®, both facilitation and training are core aspects of how we engage with individuals and 
groups, yet each serves a distinct purpose and approach.

Facilitation: 

Facilitation within Points of You® is about creating immersive experiences that evoke emotional responses 
rather than simply transferring knowledge. The facilitator’s role is to guide participants through a process 
of self-discovery, helping them connect with their emotions and insights. The focus is on making 
participants feel something through carefully curated interactions and tools. We use a wide variety 
of interventions – from verbal prompts and visual tools like vision boards and photographs, to more 
experiential techniques like body work, eco-therapy, and group healing (Facilitation.

Facilitation is about holding space for participants to reflect and grow, while respecting their personal 
journeys. The facilitator is never part of the group  – they remain an impartial guide, creating conditions 
for further personal growth . This approach emphasizes diversity and inclusiveness, bridging cultural, 
linguistic, and demographic differences. The power of Points of You® facilitation lies in the emotional 
connection and shared humanity experience. This is a core principle of what we teach in the  
Points of You® Academy.

Training: 

Training in Points of You® takes on a different role. While facilitation focuses on guiding participants 
through an emotional experience, training is about equipping individuals with the skills and tools 
necessary to apply them effectively in both their professional and personal lives. As trainers, we provide 
participants with the methodology behind Points of You® – explaining the "why" behind the processes and 
tools, as well as how to effectively apply them. Training involves a structured approach that combines 
theory with practical application, giving participants the confidence and competence to use the tools in 
their professional environments.

Unlike facilitation, which is more fluid and responsive to the emotions and energy of the group, training 
is designed to impart specific	knowledge	and	skills. Trainers offer a clear framework for the tools, 
focusing on communication, coaching methods, and their practical uses to ensure participants can 
replicate these experiences in their own contexts. In training, the emphasis is on creating mastery of the 
Points of You® methodology, ensuring that participants not only feel but also understand how to recreate 
impactful experiences in their own work.

[ 16 ]

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

Points of You® Facilitator vs. Trainer: 
Key Differences

While facilitation at Points of You® centers around emotionally charged experiences that lead to personal 
insights, training is focused on teaching and developing practical skills. Facilitators create safe spaces 
for self-exploration and emotional breakthroughs, while trainers build the competencies needed to lead 
such experiences. Both are essential in helping individuals and groups achieve growth, but each plays a 
different role in the overall Points of You® journey.

Role Focus:

Facilitator: 
A Points of You® Facilitator guides participants through immersive experiences designed to evoke 
emotions and personal insights. The focus is on creating a safe space for self-discovery, where participants 
can explore their thoughts and feelings through carefully curated activities and interventions.

Trainer: 
A Points of You® Trainer, on the other hand, is responsible for teaching the Points of You® methodology. 
The Trainer equips participants with the skills and knowledge needed to use the tools effectively in their 
own professional settings. The emphasis is on imparting practical knowledge and ensuring participants 
understand the "how" and "why" behind the processes.

Objective:

Facilitator: 
The primary objective is to facilitate personal growth and emotional breakthroughs by guiding 
participants through reflective and experiential activities.

Trainer: 
The objective is to develop the participants' abilities to independently lead and facilitate Points of You® 
experiences, focusing on mastery of the tools and techniques.

Interaction Style:

Facilitator: 
Works more fluidly, responding to the group's energy and emotions, and remains an impartial guide who 
does not become part of the group.

Trainer: 
Provides structured learning, offering a clear framework and instructions, and actively engages with 
participants to ensure they gain the necessary skills.

[ 17 ]

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

The Trainer's Role

As a Responsible Adult

Accept them as they are:
Accept the group and individuals without judgment or expectation. Be compassionate toward any 
behavior or characteristic they display.

Challenge them:
Encourage participants to step outside their comfort zones, helping them break their patterns and redefine 
what is possible for them. This might involve offering confrontation, reflection, or support.

Caring:
Provide care and attention, listening not only to what participants say but also to what they don’t express 
verbally.

Empathetic:
Understand others by putting yourself in their shoes and showing that you recognize their feelings.

Building trust and a safety net:
Create a safe environment where participants feel cared for, trust the process, and are willing to 
engage fully. Uphold group agreements at all times.

Dare to confront:
Ask challenging questions and serve as a mirror. Say what needs to be said in a straightforward manner, 
always seeking clarification rather than making assumptions.

Affectionate:
Show care and tenderness, communicating emotions effectively.

Responsible guide:
Take a guiding role, understanding what is right in each situation and managing it effectively. 
Ensure the group and individuals are safe and supported.

Respectful:
Treat everyone with respect, adhering to group agreements and being mindful of sensitive issues 
such as culture, religion, health, and personal identity.

Empowering:
Support participants in regaining their self-confidence and control, helping them take the lead 
in their own growth.

Positive	influence	on	group	dynamics:
Maintain positive energy throughout the training, especially during conflicts or challenging moments, 
turning these into opportunities for growth.

[ 18 ]

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

As a Leader

Inspiring	figure:
Believe in yourself as a leader and inspire others. Be open to learning and growth, 
acting authentically to encourage others to do the same.

Focus on people and their needs:
Prioritize understanding and addressing the real needs of participants rather than 
just responding to surface-level requests.

Service-oriented:
In every situation, assess what is relevant for both individuals and the group. 
Ensure that the needs of all participants are met, maintaining focus on the group’s objectives.

Ego-free approach:
Focus on serving the group rather than seeking personal recognition. Your role as a trainer is to meet
the group’s needs, not to appear knowledgeable or impressive.

Responsible:
Take full responsibility for the training, ensuring everything runs according to plan. 
Be reliable, accountable, and punctual.

Role model:
Training is a performance; every detail matters. Model integrity by aligning your thoughts, 
words, and actions. Constantly work to become a better version of yourself.

Team player:
Consider the needs of the entire team in decision-making. Support and mentor team members, 
allowing everyone space to grow and contribute.

Resilient:
Demonstrate self-confidence and strength in the face of uncertainty. As a resilient trainer, 
you should be able to handle any situation professionally.

[ 19 ]

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

As a Container

Acceptance of any outcome:
Be flexible and open to working with whatever arises during the training. 
Embrace unpredictability and use it to move the process forward.

No expectations:
Avoid assumptions, expectations, or comparisons. While you can control the process to some extent, 
the outcome is beyond control – work with what happens.

No judgment:
Suspend all preconceived ideas about people or situations. Approach each participant’s story 
and behavior with acceptance, allowing you to work effectively with them.

Mature approach:
Use your life experience to hold space for a variety of situations and emotions. 
Stay centered and unshaken.

Flexible:
Adapt to the changing needs of the group. Avoid rigid thinking and always remain relevant 
to the group’s needs.

Hold the space:
Maintain the safety net throughout the training, ensuring that participants feel secure enough to share 
and express themselves. Set appropriate boundaries to keep everyone safe.

Emotional containment:
Manage the full range of emotions present in the group while staying centered and professional.

Create a comfortable environment for sharing:
Encourage authentic sharing by fostering a non-judgmental, safe space where participants feel 
comfortable discussing even difficult truths.

Comfortable with sensitive topics:
Be at ease discussing sensitive issues such as discrimination, harassment, mental health, 
financial concerns, personal tragedies and more. This requires ongoing inner research and self-awareness.

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

Points of You® Training – Ground Principles

1. Creating a Safe Space

During our training sessions, participants gradually reveal more of themselves to the group, and 
sometimes even to themselves for the first time. To facilitate this, we must provide a safe environment 
where participants feel secure enough to share. Our approach combines classic group dynamics with 
coaching techniques. A safe space is essential for participants to explore and address their real issues, 
allowing for deep, transformative experiences.

2. Training Through Experience

At Points of You®, we focus on creating experiential learning rather than simply teaching theory. By 
using our tools, methods, and values, we craft training experiences that evoke emotions and foster deep 
understanding. These experiences and the emotions they generate are what make our training sessions 
memorable and impactful.

3. Embracing Diversity

We bridge personal, cultural, demographic, and linguistic differences through our methods and the 
language of photos and phototherapy. This diversity allows participants to break down patterns and 
prejudices, creating a powerful reflection of our shared humanity – our feelings, hopes, and dreams. We 
are all united in these experiences.

4. The Power of Face-to-Face Interaction

In a world dominated by virtual interactions, especially after the global pandemic, we prioritize face-toface encounters. 
There is no substitute for eye contact, a hug, a scent, a voice, or a sound. Being physically present with 
others helps us to open our hearts, remove our masks, and discover the strength and connection that 
comes from being together in a shared space.

[ 22 ]

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

The Trainer's Responsibility in the Group

1. Leading the Training Process 

Maintain the structure and timing of the training sessions. Your role is to ensure participants receive the 
full experience they signed up for. Lead the group with attention to both the big picture and the smallest 
details. 

2. Serving Both Individuals and the Group:

Ensure that every participant experiences personal growth while also fostering a sense of unity and support 
within the group. Address personal questions within the training context to benefit the whole group.

3. Creating a Safe Learning Environment:

Establish and uphold group norms to build trust and psychological security. Reinforce agreements on 
sensitivity and respect, ensuring a safe space for open communication and personal sharing.

4. Modeling and Mirroring:

Set a personal example for participants by aligning your actions with your words. Authenticity is key – 
your behavior will guide participants in their own learning and growth.

5. Active Listening:

Approach the group with an open mind, free from judgments and assumptions. Listen attentively to both 
verbal and non-verbal cues to understand and respond to participants' needs effectively.

6. Key Reminders for Trainers:

-  Always act in accordance with the group's agreed-upon sensitivity and respect.
-  Be an active presence in the training room.
-  Adapt to the group's needs and dynamics.
-  Different participants have different needs – sometimes you’ll need to support, challenge,  

or confront them.

-  Maintain humility; the training is about their growth, not your recognition.

Training Energy Modes

As a trainer, understanding and mastering the different energy modes is crucial to creating an impactful 
and effective learning environment. Energy, when applied thoughtfully and intentionally, can transform 
your sessions, engaging participants at the right moments and guiding them through their journey of 
growth.

Each mode – Lift, Cocoon, Grounding, and In the Rhythm – serves a specific purpose, from energizing 
participants to fostering and reflection. By skillfully applying these modes, you can ensure your 
participants stay engaged, supported, and connected throughout the training. This guide will help you 
navigate and balance these energies to lead effective and dynamic sessions.

  Lift

When we want to engage the room, inspire participants, and capture their attention to deliver a key 
message. This is the time to be active and energetic, using humor and enthusiasm to elevate the energy 
in the room. Keeping the atmosphere high and light helps ensure that participants remain focused and 
motivated.

  Cocoon

When we need participants to stay introspective, feeling safe and supported as they work towards their 
personal breakthroughs. This mode involves slowing down, creating a quiet, reflective space where 
participants can absorb the material at a deeper level. Use a gentle tone, be attuned to the group's 
needs, and sometimes allow silence to facilitate internal processing. The goal is to create a nurturing 
environment that encourages self-discovery and growth.

  Grounding

After deep or intense sessions, when participants may feel overwhelmed or emotionally drained, 
grounding helps to stabilize the group’s energy. This mode involves bringing everyone back to the present 
moment, balancing the energies in the room, and preparing the group for the next part of the training. As 
a trainer, your role is to be the anchor, helping participants feel centered and ready to continue.

  In the Rhythm

This mode is about maintaining a steady, engaging flow throughout the training session. Find a natural 
rhythm that keeps participants interested and engaged without overextending the energy. Like a river, this 
rhythm can vary – sometimes flowing slowly, other times picking up pace. Being in rhythm means being 
authentic and adapting to the group’s needs while ensuring the training progresses smoothly.

Points of You® Method

Points of View: The Foundation of Organizational Growth

In life and in the workplace, every situation, task, and interaction can be viewed from countless 
perspectives. The challenge lies in seeing these from a fresh, previously unnoticed angle. This is where 
real change and innovation begin.
To support this, we’ve developed an effective and easy-to-apply 4-step method that can be integrated into 
any organizational training context.

Pause
A Strategic Break
Taking a mindful pause allows teams and individuals to shift from the constant rush 
of workplace demands to a more reflective state. This step is crucial in breaking free 
from habitual thought patterns and automatic reactions that may hinder progress and 
innovation. It prepares us to approach challenges with a clearer, more focused mind.

Expand
Exploring New Perspectives
In this stage, we encourage exploring the unknown, stepping out of our comfort 
zones to discover new opportunities and insights. By considering diverse points of 
view within the team, we unlock creative solutions and innovative strategies. The 
outcome? A realization that in the workplace, as in life, anything is possible.

Focus
Making Informed Decisions
With a multitude of new ideas on the table, it’s time to focus on what matters most. 
By using targeted questions, teams can clarify and prioritize the insights that align 
best with organizational goals and the task at hand. This stage ensures that decisions 
are not just reactive, but thoughtful and aligned with long-term objectives.

Doing
Turning Insights into Action
This is where strategy meets execution. Transitioning from thought to action, we 
develop detailed action plans and set clear timelines to bring our insights to life. By 
outlining the steps needed to achieve our goals, we transform ideas into tangible 
results, driving the organization forward.

The Points of You® Values

Everything we do begins here.

It took us 4 years until we were able to put our values into words.
It started with the understanding that it is not a process of creating a list or a statement but a process of 
exposing hidden parts inside each one of us (Efrat and Yaron) and revealing who we truly are. 

From this understanding we began a journey into our personal worlds of inspiration. We explored 
situations, people, success stories, failures, different experiences that shaped our lives and were a part of 
who we would become. We each went to our own storage room, where we literally store our memories. 
We were looking for objects we kept that could somehow tell our story. We packed them in bags and 
brought them to the table - a letter, a photo, a pair of jeans, perfume, travel maps and more.

We sat down and shared our life stories. It was an unforgettable evening with lots of tears, laughs and 
insights. We looked at these significant moments of our lives and tried to extract their true essence.  
Slowly, it became clear to us that the values behind our stories connect us to one another.
That with these values at heart, we created Points of You®.

We understood that the values of Points of You® are actually a synchronization of the essence of us.

Here are the 5 Points of You® Values:

[ 27 ]

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsTable of Contents  >

Inner Research

Unexpected but Precise

[ 28 ]

Inner Research

This is a study that takes place in everything 
we do.

It begins by getting up in the morning, 
looking at myself in the eyes, and simply 
asking: “Who am I? How do I feel?” It means 
being here and now, fully present, alert, with 
all sensors receiving, collecting data from 
inside and out.

Moving, stretching and attempting to expand 
our range of vision, allowing ourselves to see 
things from a new perspective. It is a study 
that never ends, a true burning passion that 
drives our lives.

Unexpected but Precise

This is the way we communicate with our 
audience.

We start with the unexpected - we do 
something different, surprising, captivating, 
tempting, intriguing, sometimes illogical, it 
may even be disturbing. The main thing is to 
shake things up and open people’s eyes.

Behind the unexpected lies a message and it 
is precise when it is relevant - when we can 
find ourselves in it, that’s when the penny 
drops.

This is how we work - the unexpected attracts 
attention, and in a moment of alertness we 
put across a clear message. The results are 
powerful.

Chapter 1 – Points of You® Training BasicsDream

This is the big picture that keeps us moving 
forward.

Dreaming lifts us up, allowing us to explore 
from above and reach far. As we fly higher, 
more possibilities and opportunities are 
spread out before us, everything is possible.

We see the dream as a tool for leadership. A 
dream translated into a vision and a roadmap, 
a source of energy, inspiration, passion, and 
ambition. It can be passed on to more and 
more people.

Our dreams have led us to where we are 
today.

Devotion

This is our definition of working together.

We interpret ‘devotion’ in the most intimate 
sense: To devote yourself it is necessary to 
strip down and to be together. We believe that 
forming a true connection begins with putting 
down the masks and bringing ourselves into 
a clean, authentic, informal way. When we 
achieve closeness and a sense of belonging,
it is easier to move together towards the same 
goals. Bringing the strengths each one of us 
has, accepting each other with appreciation 
and kindness.

Togetherness is the strategy we are devoted 
to. If you want to join us, you’ll have to 
devote yourself in return.

Tachles *

This is the excel sheet behind our dreams.

It is important for us to look inward and to 
fly with our dreams; it is also important to 
translate them into action.

We are sworn ‘doers’: we mark targets, break 
them down into tasks, and move forward with 
determination to carry them out. From time to 
time we stop, sum up and draw conclusions, 
so we become more effective and accurate in 
the future.

True, sometimes it is frustrating, sometimes it 
takes a long time - but we have staying power, 
the question is not whether we will succeed, 
but when.

* Originally, Tachles is a German word, in 
Israel it is commonly used as slang, meaning 
“the bottom line of doing”.

Group & Team Roles – Theories and Implications

Table of Contents  >

What is a Group? 

Long-term interactions between the same people  
whose common purpose unites them.
Dr. Yaron Ziv

A number of people whose common outlook  
or character unites them.
Harold Behr & Liesel Hearst

Definition	of	a	Team:	
A team is a group of individuals who work together towards a common goal, with each member playing 
a specific role that contributes to the success of the team as a whole. Unlike a group, a team relies 
heavily on collaboration, communication, and mutual accountability to achieve its objectives.

Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, 
committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed,  
it is the only thing that ever has.
Margaret Mead

Communication & Coaching Tools

[ 38 ]

Table of Contents  >

Communication & Coaching Tools

In Points of You® training, we use a variety of communication and coaching tools to effectively deliver 
our message and achieve our goals. Each tool is designed to facilitate learning, self-reflection, and 
personal growth. 

As trainers, our expertise lies in knowing when to apply a specific tool and when to refrain, ensuring our 
interventions are timely, impactful, and aligned with the needs of both the participants and the whole 
group. This balance is key to creating a meaningful and supportive training experience.

Interaction and Intervention

Interaction

Interaction occurs when two or more people communicate or react to each other. In the context of 
training, this is the process of engaging participants in meaningful exchanges, not just through words, 
but through various forms of communication. Interaction is a powerful tool for delivering messages and 
facilitating understanding. It involves two key components:

Content: This refers to the subject, product, or message – the "What" and the "Why" that we want to 
communicate.
Communication: This is the "How" – how we deliver the content to the participants effectively.

During a lecture, there is little to no interaction; it is often a monologue where the audience remains 
passive, merely listening. In contrast, training sessions are highly interactive, with most of the material 
being delivered through dynamic exchanges, using stimulus and response to engage participants actively.

Intervention

Intervention is the deliberate action of stepping into a situation, particularly when it's challenging, 
with the intent to improve it or prevent it from worsening. In training, interventions are used to guide 
participants by offering new perspectives, breaking existing patterns, or bringing underlying issues to the 
surface. This allows participants the space they need for personal growth and healing.
In training, interaction and intervention work hand in hand. While interaction facilitates the flow of 
content and communication, intervention allows the trainer to step in when necessary to ensure the 
participant's journey is productive and transformative.

Notes on the Interaction Schema

-  The interaction schema serves as a guide to protect and facilitate effective communication, ensuring 
that the message is delivered clearly. Making mistakes is acceptable as long as they occur within the 
boundaries of the interaction schema. 

-  An example of stepping outside the schema is when we don't know the answer but feel compelled to 
provide one anyway. In this case, we disrupt the schema by shifting the focus to ourselves, leading to 
self-righteousness or countertransference. It's important to remember – it’s not about us. 

-  When someone lacks a genuine answer but pretends to have one, they lose humility and become arrogant, 
potentially leading the interaction to feel patronizing, which can cause detachment in the communication.

-  Another common error is answering a question prematurely, before it’s the right time. It’s crucial to 

remain in a state of active listening when it’s someone else’s turn to speak. 

-  Our primary focus is on Verbal and Image-based interventions, as these are central to our practice. 

When in doubt, always return to the participant's card, photo, or image as a grounding tool. 

-  Before engaging in any intervention always ask for the participant’s permission.

Content Context – Connecting the Dots

Objectives of this Tool:

1.  Clarity: 

To ensure that the message we deliver is clear and easy to understand by connecting the content to a 
wider context.
2.  Engagement: 

To engage our audience by explaining the relevance and importance of the content, thereby 
increasing their understanding and receptiveness.

When to Use:

Before presenting any significant content or message, especially when we need the audience to grasp the 
full meaning and implications of what we are sharing. This tool is essential when we want to ensure that 
our message resonates deeply with the audience.

Whom to Use With:

Use this tool with any group or individual when delivering important information, ideas, or insights that 
require the audience to see the bigger picture and understand why the content matters.

How Not to Use:

Avoid using this tool if the context is not well defined, or if the content lacks substance. Misusing the 
tool can lead to confusion or disengagement if the connection between content and context is weak or 
unclear.

The Tool Structure and Process:

1.  The Big Picture: 
  Begin by explaining why the message is important. Establish the broader context that makes the 

content relevant.

2.  Content: 
  Clearly define what you want to say – this is the core message.
3.  Communication: 
  Decide how to deliver the message effectively, ensuring that the audience understands both the 

content and its context.

Example:

"We all have endless possibilities to choose from and create (Context), but our limited perspective often 
narrows these possibilities, as we tend to view things from one fixed point of view (Content). To help 
us broaden our perspective and expand our viewpoint, let’s explore this idea together through some 
interactive questions and activities (Communication)."

PR

Objectives of this tool 

1.  Reduce Resistance:

To reduce resistance to the message that we must deliver. We prepare the ground for allowing us to 
speak up our truth.

2.  Curiosity

To create curiosity in people. ”Opening the door” for the stakeholders to listen to our message.

to deliver that might be confronting and/or unconventional.

How not to Use:

Keep your PR authentic. It should not be “over the top” and make sure that you can deliver on the 
promise. Don’t say: ”This data will change the way you see life” if it does not do so, you will loose your 
entry point next time.

The Tool Structure and Process:

1. Think ahead, do I need to attract attention, or do I need to reduce resistance and speak my truth?
2. Remind your partner the context of your meeting and your mutual objective 
3. Give your partner heads up why you think the input your about to share is important
4. Ask for permission to speak freely
5. Got permission – go all the way!

Example

I would like to share with you an important observation I have.
I believe it can help us be more precise with the action plan we are preparing,
and to increase the chance that we will achieve it successfully.
But, my observation might bring a different point of view of what we think now
and might challenge us...
I would like to share it with authentically and speak freely with you
–
afterwards, you will decide if to take it into consideration or not.
is that ok for you?
Great, so...

How to Observe a Photo/Title

How Do We Look at a Photo?

A photograph captures a moment, bringing the past into the present. It allows us to experience an 
ongoing moment, encouraging us to look at it deeply. In the context of organizational training, this 
moment can be used to reflect on various aspects of teamwork, leadership, and organizational culture.
Our interpretation of a photograph is subjective. There's no right or wrong interpretation, only 
opportunities to explore issues relevant to our roles within the organization. As professionals, using 
photos in training sessions can help shorten conventional verbal processes and lead to deeper, more 
meaningful conversations about our work environment.

Deep observation enables us to open up to new points of view, expanding our range of feelings, 
emotions, thoughts, and motivation. By asking questions, we can guide these observations toward 
specific themes relevant to organizational dynamics.

Basic Questions for Organizational Context:

1.  What do I see in the photo? (Facts related to work dynamics)
2.  What do I know about the photo? (Context: Place, time, people, situation in the workplace)
3.  What do I feel when I look at the photo? (Emotions related to organizational roles, responsibilities)

If these basic questions don't provide the depth needed, or if nuances are required, consider the 
following levels of inquiry:

[ 47 ]

Chapter 3 – Communication & Coaching ToolsTable of Contents  >

Advanced Questions for Teamwork, Leadership, and Organizational Culture:

1.  The Informative Part – Facts and Knowledge:

-  What do I see in the photo? (Identify specific roles, interactions, or organizational symbols)
-  What do I know about the photo? (Consider the work environment, team structure, or leadership 

style)

-  What is the setting of the photo? (Time, place, and context within the organization)
-  Who are the people in the photo? (Roles, responsibilities, and relationships within the team)
-  What situation is depicted? (Explore the dynamics between team members or leadership behaviors)

2.  The Plot – Observation and Interpretation:

-  What does the photo depict? (Relate to teamwork, leadership moments, or cultural elements)
-  What is the situation described in the photo? (Identify challenges, conflicts, or moments of success)
-  What message does the photo convey? (Reflect on organizational values or leadership principles)
-  What memory does this photo evoke? (Connect with past team experiences or organizational 

changes)

-  What story does this photo tell me? (Imagine how this scene plays out in your organization, real or 

hypothetical)

-  What happened just before this moment? (Consider the lead-up to a decision or action)
-  What might happen just after this moment? (Speculate on the outcomes or consequences within 

the team or organization)

How Do We Look at a Word?

Words, like photographs, carry significant weight in organizational contexts. They represent the values, 
roles, and responsibilities that define our workplace. The words we choose hold power; they can shape 
perceptions, influence behaviors, and drive change within an organization. Additionally, the words we 
choose reveal our mindset, offering insight into how we perceive and approach situations. By exploring 
the nuances of words, we can gain deeper insights into leadership styles, team dynamics, and the overall 
organizational culture.

Below is a set of questions tailored for observing a word within the context of organizational training. 
These questions can help participants reflect on key themes such as teamwork, leadership, and the roles 
they play within the organization.

Questions to Explore Organizational Themes Through Words:

1.  Exploring the Word’s Structure and Meaning:

-  What other words can be made up from the same letters?

(Consider the versatility and different interpretations of roles or responsibilities within the team.)

-  What word has the opposite meaning?

(Explore contrasting leadership styles or team dynamics, such as autocracy vs. democracy in 
decision-making.)

-  Do I like or dislike this word? Why?

(Reflect on personal feelings towards specific organizational values or cultural elements.)

-  What emotions, feelings, and memories does it arouse?

(Connect the word to past experiences in leadership, team projects, or organizational changes.)

2.  Connecting the Word to Organizational Context:

-  How does the word connect with the photo I am looking at?

(Link the visual imagery to organizational themes like teamwork, collaboration, or leadership.)

-  Would I connect a different word with the photo?

(Encourage alternative perspectives that might reveal different strengths or weaknesses within the 
organization.)

-  How does this word relate to the issue that is of concern today?

(Focus the discussion on current organizational challenges, such as improving team cohesion or 
enhancing leadership effectiveness.)

Applying These Insights in Organizational Training:

-  Encourage participants to explore words that describe their roles within the organization. Discuss 
how these words align with their actual responsibilities and the expectations placed upon them.

-  Leadership and Organizational Culture:
-  Reflect on words that are central to the organization's culture, such as "integrity," "innovation," or 
"collaboration." Discuss how these words are embodied (or not) within the leadership and day-today operations.

-  Identifying Strengths and Areas for Improvement:
-  Use words to pinpoint strengths within the team or organization, as well as areas that may need 

development. For example, explore the implications of words like "resilience" or "communication" 
and how they play out in practice.

Cutters 

Objectives of this Tool:

1.  Maintain Focus: 

To stop unwanted interactions that are not relevant to the process or the room, ensuring the session 
remains on track.

2.  Manage Participation: 

To prevent disruptions caused by participants who may dominate the conversation or steer it away 
from the intended focus.

When to Use:

Use this tool during any session when it is necessary to redirect the group’s focus or when certain 
interactions are not serving the overall objectives of the session.

Whom to Use With:

This tool is effective for use with participants who may be overly assertive, disruptive, or when the group 
dynamic needs to be brought back on track.

How Not to Use:

1.  Avoid using cutters excessively, as it may create an overly controlled environment where 

participants feel stifled. 

2.  Be cautious when applying cutters to sensitive participants who may take offense or feel 

discouraged from contributing further.

The Tool Structure and Process:

1.  Light/Friendly Cutters:

These are subtle redirections that participants often do not even notice. Always start with this level:

- 
- 

"Right," "Excellent," "You're right."
"You are right, but..." or "Wonderful, but not yet" – this approach makes the participant feel  
acknowledged while gently redirecting the focus.

-  Use body gestures like "No," "In a minute," or "Let’s do it together."
- 
- 

"Thank you for sharing," "It’s a nice idea."
"What is the question?" or "What do you ask?"

[ 50 ]

Chapter 3 – Communication & Coaching Tools 
 
 
Table of Contents  >

2.  Medium Cutters:

These are more noticeable but still need to be executed gently:

"Let’s move on," "Let’s continue..."

- 
-  A slight disregard or a simple "Thank you."

These cutters are non-personal and help keep the session moving forward. Use them with sensitivity 
and respect.

3.  Killer Cutters:

These are the most direct and are used when necessary. They will be noticed by everyone:

-  These should be done respectfully, and if needed, in a more private setting outside the room.
-  Directed personally toward the participant, ensuring the interaction remains respectful towards 

- 

both the participant and the group.
"John, I need to deliver an important point to the team, and your interruptions are affecting our focus 
Please hold your questions for now, and I promise everything will be clear by the end of the session." 

This version is concise while still being direct and respectful.

The T-Junction 

Objectives of this Tool:

1.  Encourage Decision-Making: 

To help individuals recognize the importance of making decisions, even when they feel uncertain or 
afraid of making mistakes.

2.  Promote Movement: 

To emphasize that any decision, whether perceived as good or bad, creates movement – and where 
there is movement, there is life.

When to Use:

Use this concept in situations where individuals are hesitating or struggling to make a decision, especially 
when they’ve been avoiding it for a long time.

Whom to Use With:

This tool is effective with anyone who feels stuck or is resisting change due to fear of making the wrong choice.

How Not to Use:

1.  Avoid pushing someone into a decision without understanding their concerns and fears. Rushing 

them may cause more resistance.

2.  Be careful not to dismiss the significance of their hesitation; it’s important to empathize with their 

struggle.

[ 52 ]

Chapter 3 – Communication & Coaching Tools 
 
Table of Contents  >

The Tool Structure and Process:

1.  Acknowledge the Struggle: 
  Begin by empathizing with the individual’s situation. Acknowledge their fears and the challenges they 

face in making a decision.

2.  Present the Cost of Inaction: 
  Gently highlight that sitting on the fence comes with its own set of costs – lost time, missed 

opportunities, and unfulfilled potential.

3.  Empower Movement:

-  Reinforce that there’s no “right” or “wrong” decision – only the importance of creating movement. 
Explain that by making a choice, they’ll move forward, and where there is movement, there is life.

-  Ask the participant(s) what price they believe they are paying by not making a decision, 

and encourage them to connect with the emotions that might be suppressed. Allow them to 
feel whatever comes up regarding the price they may have been paying for a long time. This 
connection can help unlock deeper motivations for change.

4.  Validate Their Choice: 
  Whether they decide to stay where they are or make a change, affirm that consciously choosing their 

path is an honorable and powerful decision.

Example:

"In life, we often avoid making decisions because we fear failure or making a mistake. But what we don’t 
always realize is that by not deciding, we’re paying a price – time continues to pass, and we miss out on 
opportunities. The T-Junction concept teaches us that it’s not about making the ‘right’ decision; it’s about 
making a decision. Movement, any movement, brings life and progress. If you choose to stay where you 
are, that’s a valid choice – but make it consciously. Understand the costs and own that decision. And 
remember, we’re here with you, supporting you every step of the way."

Integrity Principle

Objectives of this Tool:

1.	 Define	Integrity:	

To build a clear understanding of integrity, emphasizing its meaning as wholeness rather than just 
honesty.

2.  Encourage Alignment: 

To help individuals and teams align their words, intentions, and actions, achieving personal and 
collective integrity.
3.  Foster Accountability: 

To create awareness of the consequences of losing integrity and the importance of restoring it through 
acknowledgment and correction.

When to Use:

Use this tool at the start of a coaching process or when addressing situations where individuals or teams 
struggle with consistency between what they say, intend, and do.

Whom to Use With:

This tool is effective for individuals and teams who need to build or restore their integrity, ensuring 
alignment in their personal or professional lives.

How Not to Use:

1.  Avoid using this tool in a way that feels accusatory or judgmental; it should be used to foster 

understanding and growth, not guilt.

2.  Be careful not to oversimplify the concept of integrity, as it involves complex personal and 

collective dynamics.

The Tool Structure and Process:

1.  Initiate with a Question: 
  Begin by asking participants what integrity means to them. Write their responses on the board and 

acknowledge how their ideas connect to the concept of integrity.

2.	 Present	the	Definition:	

Explain that integrity refers to wholeness, not just honesty. Discuss the original meaning of the term, 
which was used to assess whether a machine was in full operational integrity, ready for use.

[ 54 ]

Chapter 3 – Communication & Coaching Tools 
 
 
 
Table of Contents  >

3.  Build the Concept:

-  Operational Wholeness: 

Just as a car is complete and ready for sale when all its parts are assembled, a person is in integrity 
when there is wholeness between three essential components: what they say, what they intend, 
and what they do.

-  The Integrity Building: 

First Floor (Say): 
Represents personal choice – your word that 
expresses who you are, your aspirations, 
thoughts, desires, and actions. 

Second Floor (Intend): 
Represents commitment – your intention 
behind what you declare. 

Alignment

Third Floor (Do): 
The physical manifestation of your intention. 
Without action, your word holds no value; 
action is what creates results.

4.  Acknowledge Human Experience:

Integrity

{ My words

My Actions

My Intention

-  Explain that we are born with integrity, but as we grow, fear and risk calculations cause us to lose 

it. We learn to say without meaning, intend without doing, and eventually avoid saying anything to 
escape commitment.

-  Discuss how losing integrity occurs when any of the components of wholeness are missing, using 

the analogy of a malfunctioning car.

5.  Create Awareness:

-  Ask participants to reflect on and share the prices they have paid or are still paying for breaches of 

integrity in their lives. 

-  Encourage them to connect with the emotions associated with these breaches and allow 
themselves to feel whatever comes up. This helps unlock deeper motivations for change.

6.  Restore Integrity:

-  Discuss how to restore wholeness after it has been broken: by acknowledging mistakes, making 

new declarations, and committing to corrective actions.

-  Emphasize that the goal of coaching is to create areas of correction and commitment to personal 

and collective integrity.

[ 55 ]

Chapter 3 – Communication & Coaching Tools 
Table of Contents  >

7.	 	Example	for	Reflection:

Imagine two trapeze artists performing in a circus, swinging high above the ground. They arrange 
to meet in mid-air, where one must let go of their trapeze, trusting the other to catch them. If the 
catching partner is even a second late, the trapeze artist who let go is left to fall. Often, there’s no 
safety net – just the cold, hard ground below. In that critical moment, integrity is everything. If the 
partner fails to catch them, no amount of apology can undo the consequences. This is the essence of 
integrity – being where you need to be, doing what you’ve committed to do, when it matters most.

8. Empower Personal Responsibility:

Conclude by inviting participants to ask themselves whether they will be there for themselves at the 
critical moment when their actions need to match their words. Reinforce that the real responsibility 
lies in their hands, and it is their choice to maintain integrity.

Example:

"In life, just as with trapeze artists, integrity is about trust and timing. It’s not just about honesty but 
about aligning what you say, intend, and do. When these elements are in sync, you achieve integrity. 
However, as we grow, fear and hesitation cause us to lose this alignment. The price we pay is frustration, 
disappointment, and mediocrity. Through this process, we will work on restoring your integrity by 
acknowledging where it has been lost and committing to corrective actions. Remember, the responsibility 
for maintaining integrity lies in your hands – it’s your choice."

The Lighthouse Principle: 
Understanding the Physical Universe

Objectives of this Tool:

1.  Illustrate the Power of Results: 

To demonstrate that results are non-negotiable and serve as the ultimate guide in decision-making and 
adjustments.

2.  Encourage Corrective Action: 

To help individuals recognize when they are off course and prompt them to make necessary 
adjustments to reach their goals.

When to Use:

Use this tool when individuals or teams are struggling to understand the importance of results or when 
there is resistance to making necessary changes. It’s particularly effective in coaching scenarios where 
goals are not being met.

Whom to Use With:

This tool is suitable for anyone who needs to align their actions with their desired outcomes, whether in 
personal relationships, business, or any other area where achieving specific results is crucial.

How Not to Use:

1.  Avoid using this tool in a way that could be perceived as dismissive of someone’s efforts or 

emotions. The focus should be on constructive correction, not blame.

2.  Be mindful not to apply it in situations where results are influenced by factors beyond the 

individual’s control without acknowledging those factors.

The Tool Structure and Process:

1.  Initiate with a Story: 

Start by sharing the story of the American destroyer SS Washington during World War II. Explain how 
the admiral, upon discovering another vessel on a collision course, ordered the vessel to adjust its 
course, only to find out that the "vessel" was actually a lighthouse. This story illustrates that, like the 
lighthouse, results are immovable and non-negotiable. Here’s the complete story:
Two battleships were on a training mission in thick fog. The lookout reported a light on the starboard 
bow. The admiral, realizing they were on a collision course, ordered the other ship to change course 
20 degrees. The reply came back, advising the admiral to change his course instead. Growing 
frustrated, the admiral asserted his authority, declaring, "I'm an admiral; change course 20 degrees." 
The response was firm: "I'm a seaman second-class. You should change course 20 degrees." Now 
furious, the admiral threatened, "I'm commanding a battleship. Alter course 20 degrees or else." The 
final message read, "I'm a lighthouse." They quickly changed course.  
Personal story of Frank Koch

2.  Present the Principle: 
  Use the story to highlight the principle that in the face of results, arguments, opinions, and ranks 

become irrelevant. What matters is the adjustment – or the lack thereof – based on the results at hand. 
Explain that ignoring results leads to collision and destruction, whether in relationships, business, or 
other areas.

3.  Apply the Principle to Real-Life Scenarios:

-  Personal Example: 

If someone aims to earn 10,000 a month but consistently earns only 3,000, their results are a clear 
signal that they are off course. Encourage them to assess what needs to be corrected – whether it’s 
the quality of their presentations, their pricing strategy, or the frequency of their outreach efforts.

-  Business Example: 

If a team intends to reach a specific target but repeatedly misses the mark, the results indicate a 
need for adjustment. This might involve revisiting the strategy, reallocating resources, or changing 
the approach entirely.

4.	Encourage	Reflection	and	Correction:	
  Ask participants to reflect on their own experiences where they may have ignored results or failed to 
adjust when necessary. Encourage them to connect emotionally with the consequences of staying off 
course and to recognize the value of making timely corrections.

Example:

"In life, just like in the story of the lighthouse, results are the ultimate guide. When you set a goal but find 
yourself repeatedly off course, the results are telling you it’s time to make a correction. Ignoring them 
only leads to further frustration and potential failure. Whether in personal goals or business objectives, 
recognizing and responding to these ‘lighthouses’ can mean the difference between success and collision. 
Remember, the lighthouse doesn’t move – it’s up to you to adjust your course."

Non-Verbal Communication

Non-verbal communication is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of interaction within organizations. 
While words convey explicit messages, our gestures, facial expressions, posture, and even the space 
we occupy can speak volumes about our intentions, emotions, and underlying attitudes. For trainers 
understanding and harnessing the power of non-verbal cues is essential to creating a cohesive and 
supportive environment.

Appearance

Observation, Not Judgment: 
Notice how participants are dressed, their hairstyle, and makeup, without passing judgment.

Language: 
Consider how voice and intonation affect communication. Pay attention to the style of speech, 
maintaining eye-level interactions. Reflect on the subtext – why something is being said, when it’s being 
said, and what remains unsaid.

Body Language

Facial Expressions: 
Observe the subtle movements of the face.

Gestures: 
Pay attention to how the body is used to express thoughts and feelings.

Posture: 
Notice how participants hold their bodies.

Mise-en-scène: 
Consider how and when participants move, and what these movements convey.

Enhancements

As a trainer, the tools and elements you incorporate into your sessions – what we call "enhancements" 
– play a crucial role in supporting the learning environment and reinforcing your message. These 
enhancements include:

Music: 
Carefully selected music can set the tone for the session, helping to create the right mood and energy 
level for your participants.

Atmosphere: 
The overall atmosphere you cultivate, from lighting to room arrangement, impacts how your participants 
engage with the material.

[ 59 ]

Chapter 3 – Communication & Coaching ToolsTable of Contents  >

Location: 
The choice of location and the organization of the space can either enhance or hinder the learning 
process. Ensure the space promotes interaction and focus. However, keep in mind that sometimes we 
must work with what’s available. For example, if trainers are invited to an organization's conference 
room, our influence over the setup may be limited. You can learn more about this under Room Setting.

Props: 
Using props such as study materials, cards, or a centerpiece can make the session more engaging and 
help participants connect more deeply with the content.
As a trainer, it’s your responsibility to thoughtfully choose and use these enhancements to create a 
supportive, immersive learning experience that aligns with your training objectives.

 Silence: 
Understand the power of silence as a communicative tool. It allows space for reflection, deeper 
connection, and can be just as impactful as words in facilitating learning.

Verbal Communication

Language: 
Use simple, clear language that is accessible and at eye level with participants.

English: 
Ensure your pronunciation is clear and your vocabulary is appropriate for the group, aiding in effective 
communication.

Clarity in Speech: 
Be straightforward and direct, ensuring your message is easily understood by all participants.

Subtext: 
Listen for and address the underlying messages in what participants say. Understanding the full context of 
their words helps in responding more effectively and facilitating deeper discussions.

Crafting Transformative Training Experiences

The true art of facilitating a successful training lies in what happens before and after the session itself. This 
chapter is dedicated to the essential preparation and follow-up practices that ensure your training not 
only runs smoothly but also leaves a lasting impact on participants and clients alike.

Before the training begins, every detail matters – from how the room is set up to how you, as a trainer, 
prepare mentally and emotionally. We say that “God is in the details” and a big part of the magic of 
Points of You® experiences comes from this planning and going into small details. 

The first section, Room Setting, guides you through creating an inviting and purposeful space that 
encourages open communication and creativity. The physical environment you create can either enhance 
or hinder the participant’s experience, making it a critical component of your preparation.

Next, in Mindset, we delve into the importance of your own mental preparation. Your mindset as a 
trainer sets the tone for the entire training. We offer strategies to help you enter the session with clarity, 
confidence, and the flexibility needed to navigate the dynamics of the group.

Understanding and aligning with the client’s needs is the cornerstone of any successful training. In 
Touchbase with Client’s Needs, we explore how to conduct effective pre-training discussions that ensure 
your session meets the client’s objectives while leveraging the Points of You® methodology to its fullest 
potential.

Finally, a training’s true success is measured by its lasting impact. The Follow-Up section emphasizes the 
importance of continued engagement, offering practical tips for reinforcing the lessons learned, gathering 
feedback, and planning ongoing support to help participants and clients implement changes long after 
the training has ended.

By focusing on these critical "Before & After" elements, you’ll be well-equipped to deliver trainings that 
are not only impactful in the moment but also resonate long after the participants leave the room.

Room Setting: Creating the Right Environment

Introduction:

The physical space where your training takes place is more than just a venue; it’s the foundation upon 
which the entire experience is built. Room setting is where the experience starts by welcoming the 
participants. As a trainer, the room is our home, and the participants are our guests during the experience. 
How we set up the space can significantly impact the dynamics of the training, influencing everything 
from participant engagement to the overall atmosphere.

A well-prepared room creates a sense of safety, openness, and curiosity, encouraging participants to 
fully engage with the content and each other. Conversely, a poorly arranged or cluttered room can 
create barriers to communication, hinder participation, and disrupt the flow of the session. Therefore, 
it’s essential to align the space with the objectives of the training, taking into account time constraints, 
communication needs, and the participants themselves.

Objectives:

-  Prepare the environment to support the participants’ learning experience.
-  Learn how to align with the physical conditions of the space.
-  Get inspired by different room setting ideas that provoke curiosity and playfulness.

Tips for Effective Room Setting:

-  Consider the Participant Experience:  

As you prepare the room, put yourself in the participants’ shoes. Visualize each step of the training: 
What will they need at each stage? Where and how will they access these resources? How much 
time will it take? Is it eco-friendly? This perspective helps you create a room setting that is welcoming, 
functional, and aligned with the Points of You® ethos. 

-  Hygiene and Freshness:  

The room must be neat, clean, and inviting. It’s our responsibility as facilitators to maintain this 
environment. Make sure the room looks and smells fresh, with no clutter, empty bottles, or discarded 
papers. Consider using essential oils like lavender to refresh the air, and open windows during breaks 
to circulate fresh air. 

-  Be Prepared:  

Arrive at least 45 minutes before the training begins to set up the space and manage any unexpected 
surprises. Hide personal belongings to keep the room looking tidy and professional.

[ 63 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

Ideal Space Arrangement:

At Points of You®, we recommend arranging chairs in a circle. This layout fosters equality, inclusivity, and 
connection, as everyone can see and be seen. It breaks down hierarchical barriers, encouraging open 
dialogue and active participation. The circle symbolizes unity, where each participant’s point of view 
holds equal value.
If possible, place tables at the sides of the room to provide space for writing materials or refreshments 
without obstructing the circle. Especially when working with ClicKit and processes where participants 
need to create something, it will be more comfortable to sit by the table. However, we don’t want them 
obstructing communication during the beginning and end of the training. As a trainer, it’s important that 
you sit on the same type of chair as the participants. This reinforces the concept of equality and helps 
build trust and openness within the group.
Ideally, we want a room with windows to let natural light in, as natural light creates a more relaxed 
atmosphere and energizes the space. If natural light is unavailable, consider how the room’s artificial 
lighting can be adjusted to create a warm, inviting environment. Dim or harsh lighting can strain 
participants' focus and mood, so aim for lighting that is gentle on the eyes and conducive to interaction.
In the middle of the room, place the centerpiece – the heart of the room. This is where participants' 
materials will be waiting, intriguing them as they enter. The arrangement of the materials should spark 
interest and curiosity, drawing participants into the experience right from the start. Additionally, we’ve 
created special roll-ups just for you, which you can find in the Marketing Kit. Once printed, position them 
strategically around the room to help set the stage and enhance the atmosphere..

[ 64 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

The Centerpiece:

The centerpiece is a focal point that anchors the training and reflects its theme. Whether you’re using 
a regular Points of You® centerpiece or creating one that resonates with the group or organization, it’s 
important to think about what will best support the training’s objectives.

If you’re working with ClicKit, consider how you want to present the kits – either on the chairs or 
arranged around the centerpiece. Similarly, if you’re using Speak Up, decide how the cards will be spread 
out and how you want the room to look when participants enter.

The centerpiece can also be customized to reflect the client’s industry or theme. For example, if you’re 
working with a shipping company, you might include model ships or related products. This adds a 
personal touch and helps participants feel more connected to the process.

You can also use the centerpiece as an element of group creation, where participants can add elements 
and co-create the space. This interactive approach not only personalizes the environment but also fosters 
a sense of ownership and involvement among the participants.

[ 65 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

Checklist:

Here are some questions to consider when setting up the room:

-  What are the content’s objectives and the participants’ profiles? Do you need a formal or relaxed 

setting?

-  Do you want tables, just chairs, or cushions on the floor? Where do you want participants to be during 

the experience?

-  Will participants need space to move around or a place to write easily?

-  Will you sit or stand during the training? Where will you place yourself in the room?

-  How should the room look when participants first arrive?

-  Where will you place the cards, tools, or stationery – on the floor, in the center, on the chairs, or on 

side tables?

-  Do you need a centerpiece? What will it include, and how does it relate to the content or the group?

-  Do you need to place something on the walls, such as flipcharts? How many, and where will they go?

-  Will participants move around during the process? Do they need to carry their own materials while 

moving?

-  How are the acoustics in the room? Depending on the number of participants and the room size, will 

you need a microphone?

-  Will you use music during the Pause, sharing part, or writing part? Where will you place the speaker?

-  How should the lighting be set for a better-quality training?

-  Where will the closure take place, and how will the environment support the power of this final 

moment?

-  Will you need a projector for the training? If yes, where will you project the presentation to? Will 

everyone be able to see it clearly?

-  Are there any cultural sensitivities that might influence the room setup? Is the space inclusive for 

everyone?

-  Can participants move easily around the room without tripping over cords or furniture? 

-  Do you have a back up plan if something doesn’t work as expected (e.g., projector issues, space 

constraints)? Be prepared with alternatives to keep the training flowing smoothly.

[ 66 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

Adaptations:

Sometimes, the client’s physical space may not be ideal for the training. Always ask for photos of the 
room beforehand and learn about its conditions. Then, think creatively about how you can adapt the 
space to meet your needs. Change the content or adjust your approach according to the reality of the 
space you have. The key is to create an environment that supports the training’s goals, even if it’s not 
exactly what you envisioned.

For example, if you have to use tables, try round ones with no corners to maintain a sense of openness 
and reduce barriers. In short sessions, consider doing parts of the training standing up together to create a 
more dynamic energy.
However, we recognize that not every venue will allow for this ideal setup. In such cases, adapt the 
space as best as you can.  

Interaction and Visibility

Key Principle:  
Whatever you decide to do in the room, ensure that it has a purpose and relevance to the group and 
the training. If an element doesn’t serve the training’s objectives or doesn’t add value to the participants, 
consider whether it’s necessary. The environment should be intentional, focused, and supportive of the 
training’s goals.

Mindset: Preparing for a Successful Training

Introduction:

Defining your mindset before facilitating a training is like building a strong foundation for the event, 
significantly increasing the likelihood of a successful and impactful session. Your mindset shapes how 
you approach the training, interact with participants, and manage the dynamics of the room. It’s about 
entering the space as a "container," ready to hold the room and guide participants through their journey. 
By taking the time to set your mindset, you align yourself with the objectives, anticipate challenges, and 
prepare to lead with confidence and clarity.

Objectives:

-  Focus and Mental Preparation:  

Defining your mindset helps you mentally prepare for the training, ensuring you have a clear 
understanding of the goals, participant expectations, and how you plan to lead the session. 

-  Flexibility and Adaptability:  

A well-defined mindset allows you to adapt your approach to various situations that may arise during 
the training, enabling effective and constructive responses. 

-  Effective Communication:  

Setting a mindset beforehand helps maintain open and respectful communication with participants, 
fostering a safe environment for sharing and learning. 

-  Understanding Participants' Needs:  

A participant-centered mindset keeps the focus on the attendees’ needs, helping you tailor content 
and approaches to meet their expectations. 

-  Building Confidence and Effectiveness:  

A clear and defined mindset enhances your self-confidence, allowing you to lead the training more 
effectively and assuredly.

Tips for Setting Your Mindset:

-  Clarify Goals and Objectives:  

Connect deeply with the goals of the training. Understand what you want to achieve, the key 
messages you want to convey, and the change you aim to bring about in the participants. 

-  Understand Your Audience:  

Get to know the company or participants you will be working with. Understand why they might need 
you at this training and what their expectations might be. Try to sense where they are coming from, 
why they are in the training, and what the “context” is for their participation.

-  Define Your Approach and Atmosphere:  

Decide on the facilitation style you want to use – whether it will be formal or informal, whether you 
will incorporate humor or maintain a serious tone. Determine the type of atmosphere you want to 
create – open, creative, supportive, or focused. 

-  Boost Your Self-Confidence:  

Reflect on your strengths as a trainer. Remember the experience and knowledge you bring to the training. 
Prepare yourself to handle pressure or unexpected challenges in a positive and constructive manner. 
Consider your growth – what do you want to do better this time? Will you approach anything differently? 

-  Mental Practice:  

Engage in guided visualization exercises: imagine yourself successfully leading the training, handling 
challenges, and receiving positive feedback from participants. This practice helps you enter a mindset 
of success and feel prepared for any scenario. 

-  Physical Preparation:  

Ensure you are physically prepared: get enough sleep, eat well, and manage stress before the training. 
Your physical well-being directly impacts your mental readiness and ability to engage fully with the 
group.

[ 69 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

Time:

The process of setting your mindset should begin during the preparation stage of the training, as you go 
over the content, refine open points, and understand what is required of you as a trainer. On the day of 
the training, allocate at least 30 minutes for a personal process in a quiet and comfortable space. Use 
this time to revisit the main points, remind yourself of your goals and strengths, and fill yourself with 
confidence and clear intentions.

Additionally, take at least 10 minutes to pause with yourself – listen to music, take a walk in nature, or 
engage in another activity that helps center you. Reflect on the qualities and intentions you want to bring 
into the room, ensuring you enter the training with a mindset that supports both you and the participants.

Integration with the Training Flow:

Your mindset is not just about preparing for the training; it’s also about how you carry that preparation 
into the session itself. From the moment you step into the room, your mindset influences how you interact 
with participants, respond to challenges, and guide the flow of the training. It’s part of "walking the talk" – 
showing up as a clean, centered trainer who is ready to hold the space and lead with intention.

Touch Base with Client’s Needs

Introduction:

Aligning the training with the client’s needs is crucial for delivering a successful session and building 
a trustworthy, long-term relationship. As trainers, we may not always be the ones who initially 
communicated with the client, and sometimes the person who ordered the training isn't the manager 
who will attend. Additionally, if a significant amount of time has passed since the initial conversation, 
things could have changed, making it important to recheck the client’s current needs and objectives.. 
Our role extends beyond simply meeting client expectations; it involves guiding them toward outcomes 
that are realistically achievable within the training’s framework. While it’s important to adapt to the 
client’s goals, we must also trust our expertise in the Points of You® method to deliver the most impactful 
experience. By balancing the client’s objectives with our proven process, we can create meaningful and 
lasting outcomes.

Objectives:

-  Clarify Client Needs:  

Develop a deep understanding of the client’s goals, challenges, and expectations. 

-  Align Training Goals:  

Adapt the training to meet client needs while preserving the integrity of the Points of You® method. 

-  Build Trust and Partnership:  

Foster a collaborative relationship with the client through clear communication and expert guidance. 

-  Prepare for Continuous Feedback:  

Establish a feedback loop to address emerging needs and adjust the training in real time.

Tips for Effective Touchbase:

-  Clarify Goals and Objectives:  

Begin by thoroughly understanding the client’s goals. Identify the changes they wish to see and how 
the training can contribute to achieving these outcomes. 

-  Understand the Client’s Context:  

Engage with the client to learn about their organizational culture, current challenges, and broader 
context. This helps tailor the training content to be both relevant and impactful. 

-  Trust the Process:  

As an expert in the Points of You® method, trust in the facilitation process. While aligning with client 
needs is important, use your expertise to guide them back to effective approaches if their requests 
deviate from the training’s objectives. 

[ 71 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

-  Address Resistance or Misalignment:  

If client expectations cannot be met within the training’s constraints, be transparent about it. Offer 
alternative solutions or adjust the session scope to ensure outcomes are both achievable and meaningful. 

-  Engage Key Stakeholders: Involve important organizational stakeholders early on to secure broader 

support for the training’s goals. This might include department heads or HR managers whose buy-in is 
crucial for success. 

-  Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences within the client’s organization that may 

influence training dynamics. Adapt your approach as needed to respect and integrate these elements. 

-  Be Prepared for the Unexpected: Stay flexible and ready to adapt to last-minute changes, unexpected 
participant behavior, or technical issues. Being prepared for the unexpected ensures a smooth training 
experience.

Checklist:

1.  Clarify Goals and Objectives:

–  Understand the client’s desired outcomes and how they envision the training contributing to these 

goals.
Identify key messages that need to be conveyed and the changes expected.

resonate with the participants. 

4.  Address Gaps and Misalignment:

– 

Identify any gaps between the client’s expectations and what the training can deliver. Address these 
openly and adjust the session scope if necessary. 

5.  Build a Continuous Feedback Loop:

–  Establish a mechanism for ongoing feedback during the touchbase phase and throughout the 

training to adapt to emerging needs. 

6.  Finalize the Training Structure:

–  Ensure the training structure aligns with the client’s needs while staying true to the  

Points of You® method. 

7.  Conduct a Pre-Session Check-In:

–  Before the session, have a final check-in with the client to confirm there are no last-minute 

changes or new developments.

[ 72 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

Time:

-  Initial Touchbase Meeting:  

Allocate 45-60 minutes for a thorough discussion of the client’s needs and expectations. It’s 
recommended to schedule this call 12-21 days prior to the training. This helps ensure that the training 
is aligned with the client’s current situation and objectives, reducing the likelihood of unexpected 
surprises. 

-  Pre-Session Check-In:  

1-5 days prior to the training, conduct a brief 10-15 minute check-in closer to the training date to 
ensure alignment and address any last-minute updates.

Other Comments/ Tips/Ideas:

-  Present Yourself as the Expert:  

Before diving into the client’s needs, introduce yourself and your experience with the Points of You® 
method. Share previous successes to build confidence. 

-  Follow-Up with a Summary:  

After the touchbase meeting, send a summary to the client for approval. This ensures everyone is on 
the same page. 

-  Involve Key Representatives:  

If possible, invite a representative manager of the employees who will benefit from the training to a 
second meeting. This helps fine-tune the training content and ensures it meets the needs of those on 
the ground. 

-  Set Realistic Expectations:  

Be clear about what the training can achieve within the given timeframe. If the client’s goals are too 
ambitious for the session length, discuss realistic alternatives. 

-  Maintain Flexibility:  

While it’s important to have a structured plan, remain open to adjustments based on the client’s 
feedback and the dynamics of the training.

Integration with the Training  Flow:

The insights gained from the touchbase meeting should be integrated into the training’s flow. From initial 
planning to final delivery, these insights guide how the training is structured, what content is prioritized, 
and how the trainer engages with participants. Keeping the client informed throughout the process 
ensures that the training remains aligned with their expectations and objectives.

By taking the time to thoroughly understand and align with the client’s needs, trainers can deliver 
trainings that are not only effective but also deeply resonant with the participants, leading to more 
meaningful and lasting outcomes.

Follow-Up: Reinforcing and Sustaining Training Impact

Introduction: 

Following up after a training is crucial for ensuring that the insights and skills gained during the session 
are effectively integrated into participants’ daily routines. It helps assess the training’s impact, provide 
ongoing support, and maintain a strong relationship with the client. By implementing a thoughtful followup strategy, trainers can extend the training’s value, promote continuous growth, and reinforce the key 
messages delivered during the session.

Objectives:

ensures that both parties have clear expectations and that follow-up actions are integrated into the 
overall training strategy from the outset.

-  Gather Participant Feedback:  

Collect feedback from participants to evaluate the training’s impact, effectiveness, and areas for 
improvement. This can be done through surveys, evaluations, or one-on-one conversations. The 
ClicKit QR code is particularly valuable, allowing participants to quickly provide light feedback about 
the trainer and the session. Analyze this feedback and prepare a summary report to share with the 
client in a follow-up meeting.

-  Provide Additional Resources:  

To help participants reinforce their learning, offer additional resources such as reading materials, 
online resources, or exercises. Encourage participants to continue using their ClicKit sets to further 
explore the insights gained during the training.

[ 74 ]

Chapter 4 – Before and After Guide Table of Contents  >

-  Follow-Up Coaching Sessions:  

Schedule follow-up coaching sessions to revisit key points, address challenges, and provide additional 
guidance. These sessions, conducted at intervals like 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the 
training, help sustain and integrate the learning. During these sessions, revisit the action items set 
during the training and help participants translate insights into tangible outcomes.

-  Maintain Open Communication:  

Keep communication lines open with both participants and the client. Encourage them to reach 
out with any questions or for further support. Regular check-ins help maintain momentum and 
demonstrate your commitment to their ongoing development.

-  Share Follow-Up Reports:  

Prepare a comprehensive report for the client after gathering feedback and conducting follow-up 
sessions. This report should include an overview of the training's impact, participant feedback, 
areas for improvement, and additional recommendations. Sharing this report in a follow-up meeting 
reinforces the training's value and identifies opportunities for future collaboration.

-  Customize the Follow-Up Plan:  

Tailor your follow-up approach based on the specific needs of the client and participants. Some 
groups may benefit from more frequent follow-up sessions, while others might require additional 
resources or different forms of support. Flexibility ensures that the follow-up is as effective as possible.

Schedule a meeting with the client within a week of the training to review feedback and discuss the 
next steps. 

-  Follow-Up Coaching Sessions:  

Conduct these sessions at intervals of 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the training. 

-  Ongoing Communication:  

Maintain regular check-ins with participants and the client, adjusting the frequency based on their 
needs.

Other Comments/ Tips/Ideas:

-  Integrate Feedback into Future Training:  

Use the feedback collected to refine and improve future trainings. This not only enhances the quality 
of your sessions but also shows the client that you value their input and are committed to continuous 
improvement.

where participants can continue discussions, share insights, and support each other’s growth. This 
fosters long-term connections and collaboration.

By implementing a comprehensive follow-up plan, trainers can ensure that the impact of the  
Points of You® training extends beyond the initial session, leading to sustained personal and professional 
growth for participants and continued value for the client.

Building Blocks of Training

In this chapter, we break down the training process into essential building blocks to help you, as 
trainers, customize your sessions to meet the needs of your clients and participants. These building 
blocks are fundamental elements that should be included in all of your Points of You® training, and 
we recommend them for any training you conduct. By focusing on these core components, you can 
ensure that each session is structured, meaningful, and impactful. These building blocks guide you in 
creating a welcoming atmosphere from the beginning, reducing participant resistance, and boosting their 
excitement. They provide a reliable and practical framework to set the right pace for your training, from 
the opening to the closing, leaving participants feeling inspired and fulfilled.

Our goal is to provide you with a solid foundation while giving you the flexibility to make each training 
your own. The text and guidelines we offer are not meant to be memorized but are designed to inspire 
you and serve as a backbone you can always rely on when seeking ideas.

For each building block, we provide the rationale behind its inclusion, key points to focus on as a trainer, 
logistics, and the flow of the process, along with examples of what to say. At the end of the chapter, we offer 
suggestions on how to adjust the timing of these elements based on the length of your session.

Feel free to adapt the language to fit your style, ensuring that the essence of what we aim to deliver 
remains intact. This approach allows you to stay true to the Points of You® methodology while infusing 
your unique personality and perspective into the training.

Remember, this chapter provides the structure – you bring the content. The more you internalize and 
personalize these elements, the more natural and effective your facilitation will become.

Once you master these basics, you’ll be ready to move on to the next chapter, where you will find 
detailed templates for our official trainings. 

As you become proficient in facilitating these building blocks and understanding how they work, you’ll

Welcome & Opening

Introduction:

The opening is the cornerstone on which we will build the entire process. This is the opportunity to set 
the tone and energy of the meeting, introduce yourself and the process, and create a first impression 
that will connect the participants to you. If done well, it sets the stage for a successful and engaging 
session, limiting the resistance in the room. If done poorly, it may lead to disengagement and a lack of 
connection.

Objectives:

-  Create a welcoming environment.
-  Encourage openness and ease through self-introduction.
-  Establish a sense of partnership and commitment to the process. 

Training Highlights:

-  This is the moment when the session is starting; participants may feel excited, stressed, or tired – we 

want to make them feel welcomed and in the right place.

-  Be welcoming and inviting, showing your energy and personality.
-  Use humor and personal warmth to make participants feel comfortable.
-  Pay attention to non-verbal cues and the energy in the room; adapt as needed.

Key Points to Remember:

1.  Opening Greeting:

-  Begin with a warm, friendly greeting to make participants feel welcome.
-  Express gratitude for the time and effort participants have taken to join the training. 

2.  Trainer Introduction:

Introduce yourself, including your professional background.

- 
-  Share a personal anecdote or experience related to the training topic to create a personal 

- 

connection.
Introduce Points of You® and the unique tools you'll be using, building excitement for the 
experience ahead.

3.  PR to the Process:

-  Use the PR tool to spark curiosity and reduce resistance. Keep the opening short and light – it’s the 

warm-up to the training.

-  Encourage participants to engage, ask questions, and offer insights throughout the training.
-  Briefly share the theme of the day and what participants will explore. Offer just a highlight, a 

promise of what’s to come.

[ 79 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Logistics & Special Preparations:

-  Follow the room setup guidelines outlined in the earlier chapter on Mindset and Room Setting.
-  Memorize your text to convey control and confidence.
-  Ensure the room is welcoming and that all necessary materials, such as a speaker for background 

music, are prepared.

-  Be mindful of where you will sit, ensuring it supports your ability to engage with the group and hold 

the room.

Welcoming Modules:

-  Opening Greeting
-  Trainer Introduction + Points of You® Overview
-  PR Tool Introduction

Example – Flow

Below is an example of an inviting high energy opening that you can follow. Your opening will be the 
same, both in the face-to-face setting and online.:

-  Welcome:

Hello everyone, and welcome to our training. I’m happy and excited to be here with you today, and I 
thank you for making the time to join us.

-  A Simple Self-Introduction:

Share your name, age, something personal, and something professional. For example: Hi, I’m Yaron 
Golan. I’m 48 years old, a father of three boys. My background is in business management and 
psychology, and I’m a business coach. As a certified Points of You® business trainer, I lead groups and 
sessions like this all over the world.

-  About Points of You®:

We create innovative tools for training and development, utilizing the powerful language of 
photos and metaphors – the language of the 21st century. Our programs teach professionals and 
organizations worldwide how to implement these tools and methodologies to meet their unique 
needs. We collaborate with global leaders like Google, Intel, and NASA, as well as small startups, 
delivering content focused on deep, transformative experiences that foster mindshifts and cultivate a 
culture of dialogue.

-  PR:

Our goal is to create a sense of acceptance, letting participants know that whatever they choose to do 
is perfectly fine, while also inviting them to embrace a challenge with excitement. For example, you 
might say: We're here to explore together, but there’s no obligation to do anything. If you decide to 
take a time out, that’s absolutely fine. However, I’d like to gently challenge you to try something very, 

[ 80 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

very small – just a little different from what you usually do. If you allow yourself to take this small 
step, you might be surprised by what you discover. No pressure, but if you’re open to doing something 
a bit differently, it could be an amazing and significant experience for you.

Timing Adjustments

Adjust your welcome to fit the overall timing of your process, ensuring it remains engaging for 
participants. It's crucial to set the right tone and atmosphere for the group, providing the necessary 
information while transitioning smoothly into the experiential activities as quickly as possible.

[ 81 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Objectives

Introduction 

Presenting the objectives at the start of a training is crucial for laying the foundation for its success. It 
provides clarity, focus, and a shared framework for all participants, setting the stage for a productive 
and engaging session. When done correctly, it connects participants to the process and encourages 
their cooperation. On the other hand, if objectives are not clearly communicated, participants may feel 
disconnected, leading to confusion or lack of engagement.

Objectives 

-  To ensure participants understand the purpose of the training and the goals they are working towards.
-  To create a safe and focused environment by clearly outlining what will be covered in the session.
-  To foster a sense of shared purpose and cooperation by clearly communicating why the group has 

gathered.

Training Highlights 

-  Preparation: The process of specifying and choosing the objectives begins long before the training. It's 
essential to align these objectives with the participants' needs and the goals of the organization.  
See the respective section in Chapter 4: Touch Base with Client Needs

-  Hidden Objectives: Often, the inviting organization may have additional, less visible objectives. For 
instance, in a team facing communication challenges, beyond the visible objectives like creating a 
safe space for conversation, there might be a goal to encourage open dialogue on complex issues.

-  Ensure the objectives are presented in a clear, focused manner with high energy to motivate 

participation. Avoid overloading with information.

-  We should have a more focused energy at this stage, to make sure we present in a clear and easy to 

understand way.

-  Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences in communication styles and expectations. Adjust 
your approach to ensure all participants feel included and respected, tailoring your language and 
presentation style to suit the group’s cultural diversity.

Key Points to Remember

-  Direction and Focus:  

Clear objectives help participants understand the training's direction and what they are expected to 
achieve, aiding their focus and engagement. Ideally they should be one sentence in length. 

-  Assessing Success:  

Clear objectives allow both the trainer and participants to track progress and measure the training's 
success based on these predefined goals. 

-  Taking a Time Out:

We recommend that the first objective in every training be: "To take a time out for yourself." This 
invites participants to slow down, step away from their hectic routines, and reconnect with themselves 
and their colleagues from a fresh perspective. It is an objective that resonates with everyone in the 

[ 82 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

room, offering a much-needed pause and helping to set a different tone of energy. This creates the 
space for participants to be present, fostering genuine connection and engagement.

Logistics & Special Preparations

-  No special preparations, same setting as for the whole Welcome and Opening.
-  In the online setting you may want to create a visual like presentation slides, so that participants can 

also read the objectives from their screens as you explain them.

Objective Modules

-  Introduction to the objectives
-  Presentation of objectives
-  Check clarity

Example – Flow

Below is an example of a focused objectives introduction, that you can follow. Your opening will be the 
same, both in theface-to-face setting and online:

-  Introduction of Objectives 

Our meeting today has several objectives. I will present these to ensure we all know what to expect 
and what we aim to achieve together. 

-  Presentation of objectives 

Identify personal and professional stressors. 

Present the objectives as defined in the training structure. These are some examples of objectives from 
our trainings:
–  Explore and identify the personal strengths each team member brings to the team.
–  Recognize and appreciate the unique contributions of each team member to our success.
–  Reflect and connect to enhance teamwork and performance.
– 
–  Distinguish between motivating factors versus inhibiting stress factors.
–  Find new coping strategies to deal with pressures.
–  To take a time-out and see things from a wider perspective.
–  To meet with my colleagues from a new and collaborative point of view.
–  To co-create a shared understanding of what bonding and connection mean to the team.
–  Gain new perspectives about myself. 

-  Ckeck clarity

Check if the objectives understood by everyone. 

Timing Adjustments

-  Adjust your objectives to fit the overall timing of your process, ensuring it remains engaging for 

participants. We recommend not to have more than three objectives for your sessions.

[ 83 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Sensitivity & Respect

Introduction:

Establishing a group contract that emphasizes sensitivity and respect is crucial for a Points of You® 
training. By setting clear group norms, we create a safe environment where participants feel valued 
and heard. This foundation fosters open, honest dialogue, leading to more meaningful connections and 
impactful outcomes. Without these norms, participants may feel uncomfortable and disengaged, limiting 
their willingness to share and explore deeply.

Objectives:

-  Establish a safe space where participants feel comfortable sharing.
-  Promote empathy and respect for diverse perspectives.
-  Ensure the group remains focused on the training's goals.

Training Highlights:

-  Non-verbal Communication: Use open body language and positive facial expressions to encourage 

participation and make participants feel comfortable.

-  Language Sensitivity: Choose your words carefully to avoid bias or insensitivity. Take your time to 

ensure that everyone understands and feels included.

-  Adaptability: Stay flexible and be ready to adjust your approach based on the group’s needs and dynamics.

Key Points to Remember:

1.  Clarity:

-  Ensure that the Sensitivity & Respect guidelines are clear and understandable for all participants.
-  Remember, this is your foundation for creating a safe space, so don’t hesitate to revisit and 

reinforce these points as needed.

2.  Walk the Talk:

-  Whatever is agreed upon by the group applies to you as well.
-  For example, if the rule is to keep phones on airplane mode, make sure your phone is also on 

airplane mode.

-  Lead by example, showing that you are committed to the same standards.

3.  Upholding the Guidelines:

-  Be proactive in maintaining the Sensitivity & Respect agreement throughout the training.
-  If you notice any breaches, address them personally in a gentle, private manner, ensuring the 

participant is aware of the issue without bringing unnecessary attention or embarrassment to them 
in front of the group.

-  If you feel the group is not fully upholding the agreement, bring everyone together to discuss and 

reaffirm the guidelines.

[ 84 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Logistics & Special Preparations:

-  Follow the room setup guidelines outlined in the earlier chapter on Mindset and Room Setting.
-  In the online setting, consider having a slide with the Sensitivity & Respect points listed out. 

Sensitivity & Respect Modules:

-  Introduction of Sensitivity & Respect
-  Sensitivity & Respect Points
-  Check for Understanding and Agreement

Example – Flow

Below is an example of a grounded and clear  Sensitivity & Respect you can follow. Your approach 
should be consistent, whether in a face-to-face setting or online:

-  Introduction of Sensitivity & Respect:

We will start by creating a safe space that supports us in being ourselves. In many trainings, this is 
called the ‘group contract.’ But for us, it’s more than that. It’s about making us all feel comfortable and 
safe to bring our authentic selves into the room. Sensitivity and Respect are for ourselves and for others.

-  Sensitivity & Respect Points:

Introduce the key points that you wish the group to follow:

a.  What said in here stays here in the room

This is how we build our safety net. Of course, you can share the experience with others outside – 
but only about yourself. We want you to feel free and confident to express yourself fully. 'Sharing 
out' includes all social media like Facebook, Instagram, etc. Please ask for permission if you want 
to upload someone’s picture. 

b.  Be Gentle  

To 
'Be Gentle' means approaching yourself and others without judgment or expectation. During the 
training, be patient and gentle with yourself regarding what you are willing to share. If something 
feels too much, don’t push it. Respect the other participants by being compassionate as you listen 
to their opinions, and do your best to withhold judgment, expectations, or criticism.

c.  No distractions 

Smartphones as communication devices are not allowed during the training. Smartphones are 
designed to grab our attention. Let’s try to break this pattern, even an addiction. It’s not easy, but 
use your phone only as a camera. No texts, apps, or anything else. Let’s give ourselves a chance to 
focus inward rather than outward.

We want your 100% presence here – not just your body, but also your mind and heart. Listen to 
yourself and others, and observe what is happening within you. Notice what triggers you, what 
catches your attention, and what brings you stillness. I would appreciate it if you stay in the room 
during sessions and avoid small breaks unless absolutely necessary. Ask yourself why you need to 
step out. The more you are present, the more you will benefit.

e.  Be on time

Punctuality is key – not just according to the clock, but in the process. I recommend arriving 5 
minutes before we start. The training room will be open 10 minutes before. Give yourself a smooth 
transition. If someone is not here, I will not start, so it’s your responsibility to be on time because 
everyone else will be waiting for you. Remember, being on time is a state of mind, not just a time 
on the clock. When we are on time, everything happens at the right moment  

f.  I statement 

We are here to share ourselves. Often, we talk about 'we,' 'others,' or 'people,' and it stops being 
about us and becomes about them. We will use 'I statements' – I feel... I think... We are here to be 
daring and take ownership of our words and perspectives.

-  Check for Understanding and Agreement:

Does anyone have any questions or want to add anything to our Sensitivity & Respect? (give some 
time for the question to echo in the room and see do the participants wish to add anything, then 
continue). 
Does everyone agree? Please raise your hand so I can see that we have everyone’s approval.
(Check that everyone in the room is raising their hands. Encourage them to raise their hands fully, 
reinforcing the sense of a binding agreement.)

Timing Adjustments

Tailor the Sensitivity & Respect section to fit the length and needs of your training. For shorter sessions 
(up to 2 hours), focus on key points A to C. In longer sessions, include the additional points as well. 
Remember, Sensitivity & Respect is designed to create a safe environment that supports your training’s 
objectives. Feel free to add any additional points that will help achieve this.

Pause

Introduction:

Pausing is a fundamental part of the Points of You® Method. No matter the length of the training, we 
always begin with a Pause, setting the stage for everything that follows. Pausing allows participants to 
disconnect from the hectic pace of their daily lives, step out of the constant "doing" mode, and simply 
"be." This moment of stillness helps participants to meet themselves, observe their physical body, 
thoughts, and emotions from different points of view, and prepare their minds for deeper engagement 
with the training content. The efficiency of how we pause directly impacts the quality of the training 
experience.

Objectives:

-  Encourage participants to take a time out.
-  Create space for participants to connect with themselves and reflect on their inner state.
-  Help participants tune their energy and mindset to align with the workshop’s content and theme.

Training Highlights:

-  Softer Energy: As you guide the pause, slow down your energy to create a calming, grounding 

atmosphere. Transition smoothly from the excitement of the opening to a more subtle, reflective 
energy. This shift helps participants stop "running" and truly pause.

-  Explain the Pause: Before initiating the pause, clearly explain its purpose. Emphasize the importance 
of stepping out of the "doing" state and simply being. If participants understand the purpose behind 
the pause, they will be more receptive to the experience.

-  Tailor the Pause: The pause must be relevant to the content, timing, and participants. Whether it’s a 
music pause, dynamic pause, or another method, choose the approach that best suits the training’s 
objectives and the group’s needs.

-  Handling Resistance: Some participants might find it challenging to pause, especially if they’re not used 
to slowing down. If discomfort or resistance arises, encourage participants to embrace whatever feelings 
come up, even if it’s discomfort. Remind them that it’s normal to feel uneasy when stepping out of their 
usual rhythm, and that this discomfort can be part of the process of reconnecting with themselves.

Key Points to Remember:

1.  Power of Pause:

In many trainings, the Pause is one of the most impactful moments for participants. It provides a rare 
opportunity to sit and do nothing – don’t skip it.

2.  Focus on the Theme:

The Pause helps participants begin the training on a personal, internal level. By encouraging them to 
think about the training's theme, they begin to connect with its meaning, making it the start of their 
experiential process.

3.  Pause is for you

The Pause is also your time to ground and reconnect with yourself. After the excitement of the opening, 
take this moment to center yourself and gather the energy and clarity needed for the process ahead.

Example – Flow

Below is an example of how to guide participants through the closure process:

-  Preparation with ClickIt

Before we dive deep into the process, let’s take a moment to make all the necessary preparations so 
that we can be fully present. In a moment, I will ask you to open your ClicKit. I’ll play some  music 
(Discovery Playlist: Apple Music | Spotify), and you will have 4 minutes to explore and familiarize 
yourself with this special kit.
First, separate the Photo cards and Question cards from the set by carefully tearing them apart. Then, 
take a moment to browse through the journal and other materials. After 4 minutes, ensure you have 
12 individual Photo cards and 8 Question cards ready, along with your journal, a pen, and the sticky 
notes. Once you've completed this, close your ClicKit and set it aside. You should only have the 
separated cards, your journal, pen, and sticky notes in front of you.
Any questions? Great. We’ll do this in silence, allowing the music to guide you. Take this time to 
explore and connect with the materials, and let the process unfold mindfully. Enjoy this moment of 
discovery. See you in four minutes.

-  PR to Pause:

Pausing is an integral part of the Points of You® Method. We are going to take some time to ourselves 
and just be – meeting ourselves, observing, and reflecting on our physical body, our thoughts, and 
our emotions. In the 21st century, it’s almost a radical act to do nothing. We’re constantly in a doing 
mode, rushing from one task to the next, with deadlines and to-do lists controlling our day. But here, 
today, we’re giving ourselves permission to take a time-out, to pause. If you allow yourself to truly 
pause today, it could be priceless.

-  Pause Activity:

– 

In Points of You® we pause by sitting and listening to music. In a minute I will play a track of music 
lasting 5 minutes. Please sit comfortably, without anything in your hands, no equipment on your 
lap, and try to sit in an open position, what I mean without crossing your legs or arms. If you need 
to, lean on something for support. I'm inviting you to close your eyes during the music, so you 
can really tune in to yourself. Try to stay as aware as possible, be still, and allow yourself to fully 
engage in this Pause. To simply doing nothing – but it’s all about feeling at ease and at home in this 
moment. Prepare yourself, and remember, the most important thing is to feel comfortable.

–  During the pause I invite you to think about the theme of the training and what it means for you. 

You can remind the participants about the core theme of your training.

–  We recommend to switch off the lights, close the window shades to create this space of being with 

yourself. Play the pause music and do the Pause together with your participants.

-  Closing of Pause:

–  After the music ends, take a moment to slowly transition back. Count to ten in your head before 

speaking, then softly say: "Thank you for the Pause. Take your time, and when you’re ready, I invite 
you to come back to us." As you speak, gently bring the lights back on and open the window 
shades, allowing natural light to flow into the room. Gradually increase your pace and energy, 
guiding the participants to the level of energy you want them to reach. This shift in both pace and 

[ 89 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

environment helps participants transition smoothly, aligning them with the precise energy you 
intend, while maintaining the grounding atmosphere you've established.

–  After the Pause,move to the next part of the training. This calm and reflective state that they’ve 
reached during the Pause will help them engage more deeply with the content that follows. 
Pause is not an isolated activity but a crucial part of the overall flow that enhances their ability to 
connect with the content of the training and with each other.

Different Pause Variations:

Below are some ideas for other versions of Pause that you can do. What is important check that it fits the 
theme of your trainings, the audience, group's physical ability and that you have the space to do what 
you want to do:

-  Music Pause:  

Select music that disrupts patterns and takes participants out of their comfort zones. Less familiar, nonlyrical tracks in rare languages work well. Experiment with the music, it can be calm but also up beat. 
The pause should last at least 5 minutes, and you can extend it by playing multiple tracks.

-  Dynamic Pause (Dancing):  

If space allows, guide participants in a dynamic pause with music. Be mindful of the participants' 
physical abilities, and ensure the space is suitable. Keep the activity at least 5 minutes long.

-  Walking Pause:  

Instruct participants to walk at a certain pace, to be in silence and engage in non-verbal 
communication through eye contact. Instrumental music can guide the pace. If in nature, provide 
specific instructions related to the training’s objectives and ensure participants are prepared (e.g., 
comfortable walking shoes).

-  Writing Pause:  

Encourage participants to reflect by writing for at least 4 minutes. This kick-starts inner dialogue and is 
especially effective when paired with non-verbal music. Ensure writing materials are ready before the 
pause begins.

-  Guided Meditation, Breathwork, or Storytelling:  

These are active forms of pausing where the trainer leads with clear, timed instructions. Slow down 
your speech, allow pauses between instructions, and adjust your voice volume to maintain a calming 
atmosphere.

Timing Adjustments

-  Shorter Sessions (under 60 minutes): A minimal pause could involve just taking a few deep breaths or 

listening to a short piece of music.

-  Longer Sessions (over 4 hours): Considerr a longer playlist or offer participants time to write in their 
journals after the music to kick-start their inner dialogue and reflect on what came up for them.

Points of You / Points of View

Introduction: 

At Points of You®, our approach is all about embracing multiple perspectives. Whether in a personal or 
professional setting, the ability to explore different points of view fosters open-mindedness, empathy, and 
deeper understanding. The name "Points of You" reflects this philosophy: while it is spelled "You" – Y-O-U 
– it sounds like "Points of View," emphasizing the idea that there are infinite ways to see and interpret the 
world around us.
This approach is foundational not only to our training but to the core philosophy of our company. When 
introduced effectively, it helps participants and teams break free from rigid thinking patterns, foster 
collaboration, and achieve meaningful personal and professional growth. It also plays a crucial role in 
reducing resistance to hearing other perspectives. Without this understanding, participants may struggle 
to open themselves to new viewpoints, feeling a need to “protect” their own.

Objectives:

-  Encourage participants to feel safe in sharing their unique points of view.
-  Reduce resistance in the room. By acknowledging that if participants feel anger, confusion, or 
disagreement, it means they are stepping out of their regular points of view and engaging in 
meaningful work.

-  Expand perspectives to gain new insights, enabling new actions.
-  Introduce the foundational philosophy of Points of You® and how we work.

Trainer Highlights:

-  Introduce Early: Present the concept at the beginning of the training. This sets the stage for what’s to 

come and builds curiosity.

-  Be Prepared: Have examples ready to illustrate the concept effectively.

Key Points to Remember:

-  Clarity:

Ensure that participants understand the concept of Points of You® and its importance throughout the 
training. 

-  Reinforce Through Examples: 

Use relatable stories, like how different people perceive the same piece of music in unique ways. 
Encourage participants to reflect on their own experiences and how they form their points of view.

-  Invite Participation:  

Create a safe space for participants to openly share their perspectives without judgment. Reinforce 
that there is no right or wrong perspective–only different points of view.

Points of You / Points of View Modules:

-  Understanding the Essence of Points of You®
-  Experiencing Perspectives
-  Exploring Your Own Perspective

[ 91 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Example – Flow

Below is an example of a high-energy and interesting Points of You / Points of View block that you can
follow. Your approach should be consistent, whether in a face-to-face setting or online:

-  Understanding the Essence of Points of You®:

Welcome, everyone. Before we dive in, I want to take a moment to share the essence of what we 
do at Points of You® and what today’s training is all about. The name "Points of You" holds a deeper 
meaning. While it’s spelled "Points of You" – Y-O-U – it sounds like "Points of View." This double 
meaning reflects what we believe: that there are infinite perspectives on everything – whether it’s an 
object, a situation, a person, or even a sound.
At any given moment, we each view the world from our own unique angle, shaped by our 
experiences, beliefs, and emotions. Today, we will explore how these different points of view help 
us grow and see beyond what’s in front of us. Our goal in this training is to create a space for you to 
share your perspective, challenge fixed ways of thinking, and unlock new insights.

-  Experiencing Perspective:

To demonstrate this idea of varied perspectives, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about the 
music we just listened to. Please respond by raising your hand based on how you authentically feel:
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
–  Finally, If you wanted the music even louder, raise your hand.

If you enjoyed the music, please raise your hand.
If it wasn’t your style, raise your hand.
If you thought the music was too long, raise your hand.
If it went by quickly, raise your hand.
If the music felt too loud, raise your hand.
If the volume was perfect, raise your hand.

Thank you. Now here’s something interesting: although we all listened to the same music, you just 
saw that each of us experienced it differently. Some of you might have imagined yourself dancing, 
while others felt a bit uncomfortable. This is the power of perspective – the sound was the same for 
everyone, but the experience was unique for each person.

This brings us to the core of Points of You®. When we talk about 
points of view, we’re really talking about our sight, our ability to see. 
At any given moment, we can see about 170 to 180 degrees in front 
of us. But there’s another 180 to 190 degrees behind us – our blind 
spots, areas we cannot see but which hold new opportunities and 
insights for growth.

In our daily lives, our fixed points of view represent the habits and 
patterns we rely on – the stories we tell ourselves. These are the things 
we’re so sure about that we often don’t even question them. But when 
we explore those blind spots, we step outside our comfort zone and 
start to see new possibilities.

[ 92 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

At Points of You®, we aim to help you expand your point of view. Today, we’ll guide you in stepping 
outside your fixed perspectives and looking at things from different angles. It might feel uncomfortable 
at first – but that discomfort is a sign of growth. When you feel confused or frustrated, it means you’re 
accessing new areas you usually don’t see.

-  Exploring Your Own Perspective

Now, let’s talk about the "You" in Points of You® – your authentic point of view. How much of your life 
do you really express as yourself? In the way you speak, dress, or work, how often do you show up 
as the real you? And how often do you hold back, staying silent because you worry, “Maybe people 
won’t like it?”

In today’s training, you will have the space to bring your authentic 
self to the table. I invite you to leave behind calculations and speak 
up as you truly are. You’ll also have the chance to reflect – to ask 
yourself how much you’re truly allowing yourself to express who 
you are.

Remember, this training is about more than just theory. It’s about 
practising the ability to see and hear different points of view and 
share your own!
So, are you ready? Let’s begin.

Timing Adjustments

-  Short Sessions (up to an hour): Focus on the practical example in the "Experiencing Perspective" 

module. Ask participants how they experienced the exercise, whether they found the music too long, 
too short, too quiet, or too loud. Highlight the diversity of perspectives and emphasize that there’s 
no right or wrong way to experience something. If time is limited, avoid the longer stories like the 
"Balloon" story and keep the session focused on quick, interactive demonstrations. 

-  Longer Sessions: In extended training sessions, you can delve deeper into the "Understanding the 

Essence of Points of You" module by exploring how perspectives influence different aspects of life – 
family, work, relationships. Transition smoothly into the "Exploring Your Own Perspective" module 
by inviting participants to reflect on their own lives. Ask them to consider: How often do I hold back 
from being my authentic self? Encourage participants to bring their true selves into the space, without 
judgment. In these longer sessions, you can also discuss how expanding our points of view unlocks 
new opportunities and helps navigate life’s challenges more effectively. 

-  Additional Inspiration: For longer sessions, you can introduce the story of "Points of View" from The 
Coaching Game, which explores the opportunities hiding in seeing a different perspective. You can 
share the story at the beginning in the Understanding the Essence of Points of You® part. 

[ 93 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Points of View Story (from The Coaching Game): 

Many years ago, the owner of a large shoe factory decided to expand his business and open up new 
markets. To this end, he sent two of his top executives to investigate the Asian market, giving each 
one the task of collecting data and all kinds of information from different parts of the continent. After 
weeks of sailing, the first executive arrived at his destination, disembarked, and was shocked by what 
he found: none of the natives wore shoes; in fact, they had never heard of them. The man sent an 
urgent message to his boss: "I have arrived and found that no one here knows about shoes. We will 
not be able to sell a single pair. I will return immediately..."

The second employee also sailed for several weeks until he landed at another port on the Asian 
continent. He too could not believe what he saw when he disembarked: not a single person wore shoes; 
in fact, they had never heard of them. The man sent an urgent telegram to his boss: "I have arrived. 
People here do not wear shoes; in fact, they know nothing about them. The potential is enormous, and 
the market is huge. We can sell millions of pairs a year. I have already started making contacts."

Focus & Action

Introduction:

As we move toward the end of our training, the focus shifts from expanding perspectives to organizing 
and applying the insights gained. After the expansive phase of exploring various points of view, it’s crucial 
to help participants focus on the most relevant insights for them, both personally and professionally. This 
process allows them to organize their thoughts, create clarity, and translate these insights into actionable 
steps. When done well, this final stage ensures that participants leave with a clear sense of purpose 
and practical steps to take forward. However, if we rush or skip this process, participants may feel 
overwhelmed, leaving them confused and unable to apply what they’ve learned effectively.

Objectives:

-  Understand the importance of the focusing and action process within the training structure.
-  Inspire participants with different strategies for translating insights into actions.
-  Prepare for potential difficulties that participants may face during these stages.

Training Highlights:

-  Collecting Insights: At this stage, participants are often filled with thoughts and ideas. Help them 

organize these into clear, actionable insights.

-  Energy Management: As energy may decline towards the end of the session, it’s important to re-

energize the group and focus on the outcomes of the process.

Key Points to Remember:

1.  Clarity and Focus:

Encourage participants to organize their thoughts and focus on the most meaningful insights.
This process helps create inner clarity and a sense of completion.

2.  Actionable Steps:

Emphasize the importance of moving from insight to action. Without this step, participants may leave 
with a good feeling but no practical way to implement what they’ve learned.

3.  Supporting Implementation:

Offer support in formulating practical actions. Encourage participants to share their plans and get 
feedback to ensure their actions are realistic and achievable.

4.  Small Bites:

Sometimes, after having a significant insight, participants feel compelled to take big, bold steps. 
However, in reality, when they start moving forward, they might find it difficult to execute such large 
actions, causing them to stall and stay where they are. Our goal is to encourage participants to take 
small, manageable steps – actions that are completely doable, dependent only on them, with a clear 

[ 95 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

starting and ending time that they are willing to commit to. By successfully completing these small 
actions, participants can create a ripple effect, leading to more significant and lasting change.

Logistics & Special Preparations:

-  Ensure participants have physical or digital means to write down their insights and actions. In face-toface settings, they can use their journals from ClicKit; in digital settings, they can use their Speak Up 
Digital Journal.

Focus & Action Modules:

-  Introducing to Focusing
-  Focusing
-  Sharing Insights
-  Introduction to Action
-  Action
-  Closing

Example – Flow

Below is an example of how to guide participants through the focusing and action process. Please note 
that the official templates have specific steps in this phase of the process. However, the structure below 
will be perfect for any general trainings and serves as the backbone for other variations:

-  Introduction to Focusing:

Thank you for sharing and expanding perspectives. We are now approaching the final stages of our 
meeting. It’s time to collect our thoughts and reflect on the insights that have emerged, whether 
through individual work or group discussions. We believe it’s important to organize what we’ve gone 
through, so let’s take a few minutes for personal reflection.

-  Focusing:

–  Self-Reflection: Invite the participants to take a few minutes to write down their main insights, 

conclusions, or relevant points that stand out to them. Allow 2 to 5 minutes for this.

–  Main Insight: Now that participants have had some time to reflect, ask them to choose one main 

insight they are taking with them. 

-  Sharing Insights:

–  Option 1: Ask if anyone would like to share their key insight. Depending on the time available, 

allow 2-3 participants to share.

–  Option 2: Ask participants to choose one word or title that represents their main insight, and then 

each participant can share it with the group. 

[ 96 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

-  Introduction to Action 

Now that you have identified your main insight, it’s time to think about how to turn that insight into 
real, tangible change. This step may seem easy, but it is a critical stage where true transformation 
begins. I encourage you to commit to an action that is outside of your regular routine – something that 
may challenge you, but which you believe has the power to bring about the change and clarity you 
are seeking. Remember, this is the moment where ideas turn into impact.

-  Action:

Our goal now is not only to leave with meaningful insights but to apply them in our daily lives. I 
invite you to move from the insight phase to the action phase. Focus on your main insight and ask 
yourself: What actions can I take to express this in my everyday life? Each action should be practical, 
measurable, and something you can control. Please write down one action you can take in the next 
24 hours, a second action for the coming week, and a third action to implement in the coming month.

-  Closing:

Check that everyone has written their action steps, and then we will move to the closure of the 
training.

Timing Adjustments

-  For Shorter Sessions (up to 2 hours): Invite participants to quickly write down their main insight and 
skip the sharing phase. Move directly to action planning and ask them to share their main insight in 
just one word during a quick round. 

-  For Longer Sessions: If more time is available, allow for more extensive sharing of insights and actions. 
Participants can work in pairs or small groups to discuss their main insight and help each other with 
action planning. Encourage them to find accountability partners within the group to support the 
implementation of their chosen actions.

[ 97 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

Closure

Introduction:

Closure is a crucial component of any training, reinforcing learning and ensuring that participants leave 
with a clear understanding of the key takeaways. During the closure, we summarize the main points 
covered, revisit key insights, and solidify action items. This process helps participants consolidate their 
understanding and prepares them to apply their new knowledge in real-world scenarios. Skipping or 
rushing through the closure can leave participants feeling unsettled or confused, diminishing the impact 
of the session.

Objectives:

-  Define how to effectively close a training session.
-  Ensure participants leave with a clear understanding of the key takeaways and action items.
-  Reinforce the importance of the closure in creating a lasting impact.

Training Highlights:

-  Energy Management: As we close the training, it’s important to lift the energy and leave participants 
feeling excited about their journey. Acknowledge their efforts and celebrate their achievements.

-  Creating Wholeness: Ensure all participants feel complete and energized by the journey they’ve been 

on. Leave them with a strong desire for more, creating anticipation for future sessions.

-  Positive Closure: End the session on a positive note, whether through a group photo, clapping 

together, or another symbolic gesture. Be the last to leave the space, ensuring everyone feels complete 
and ready to move forward.

Key Points to Remember:

1.  Summarize Key Points::
  Recap the key moments and insights from the session, including participant feedback and reactions.

2.  Clarify Next Steps:
  Clearly outline any follow-up actions or steps that will take place after the session, emphasizing their 

importance in driving change.

3.  Invite for Feedback:

Encourage participants to provide feedback on the session, highlighting its importance for future 
improvements and collaborations.

[ 98 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building Blocks 
Table of Contents  >

Logistics & Special Preparations:

-  Ensure that the space is arranged to facilitate an open and warm environment for final reflections and 

farewells.

-  Have your ClicKit Trainer ID code ready so participants can provide feedback and receive their certificates.

Closure Modules:

-  Summarize Key Points

Example – Flow

Below is an example of how to guide participants through the closure process:

-  Summarize Key Points:

As we come to the end of our session, let’s take a moment to revisit the key points we’ve covered 
today. From our initial discussions to the insights we’ve gained, each step has been crucial in shaping 
the outcomes of this training.

-  Clarify Next Steps:

Moving forward, remember the action plans we’ve discussed. These steps are essential in translating 
today’s insights into real-world changes. We’ll be following up with [specific follow-up actions, if 
any], and I’m here to support you as you take these next steps.
For more details on how to continue your journey, see the Follow-Up section in Chapter 4.

-  Feedback & Certificates:

Your feedback is invaluable to me, as it helps us continuously improve and create even more 
meaningful experiences. At the bottom corner of your ClicKit, you’ll find a QR code. Please scan it, 
enter my Trainer ID (e.g. 0001), and from the list select our training. You’ll be prompted to answer a 
few questions about today’s meeting, and afterwards, your certificate will be emailed to you.
(Give participants time to fill out the feedback form).

-  Sharing Reflections:

–  Participants: Before we close, I’d love to hear any final reflections or takeaways. What stood out to 
you most today? What are you taking with you as you leave? You can share in one word or a short 
sentence.

–  Trainer: Before we say our final goodbyes, today, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude 

to each of you for your contributions today. Your openness and engagement have made this session 
truly impactful. This session reminded me of the power of collective learning and the incredible 
potential we all have when we come together with open minds and hearts.

[ 99 ]

Chapter 5 – Training Building BlocksTable of Contents  >

-  Say Goodbye:

As we conclude, let’s celebrate the journey we’ve been on together. Consider a group photo or 
another closing ritual.  Thank you again for your participation. I wish you all the best as you carry 
these insights forward.

Timing Adjustments

-  Shorter Sessions (up to 2 hours): Focus on summarizing key points, expressing gratitude, and clarifying 
next steps. Invite participants to quickly share a single word or short reflection that captures their key 
takeaway before saying goodbye. 

-  Longer Sessions (over 2 hours): Allow more time for sharing reflections and takeaways. You can also 
incorporate a more elaborate closing ritual, such as pairing participants to discuss their insights 
or sharing action plans in small groups. This extra time can help deepen the sense of closure and 
community among participants.

Building Block Timing Guide

The timing of your training is a crucial factor in ensuring that the participants remain engaged, energized, 
and fully benefit from the experience. The structure we've provided in the building blocks – from 
Welcome to Closure – serves as a comprehensive guide for crafting a successful session. However, 
depending on the overall duration of your training, you’ll need to adjust the timing of each section to fit 
the flow and maintain the right balance of energy and focus.

Opening the Training: Setting the Stage

The first five building blocks (Welcome, Objectives, Sensitivity & Respect, Pause, and Points of You /  
Points of View) form the opening of your training. This stage is all about getting your participants 
excited, aligned, and ready to dive into the content. It’s during this phase that you establish the tone, set

Adapting the Timing

While the timing guidelines above provide a structure, it’s important to remain flexible and responsive to 
the needs of your participants. 

Consider the group dynamics: Sometimes the pace of the training may need to be adjusted based on the 
energy and dynamics of the group. For example, if the group is particularly engaged in a discussion, it 
might be worth extending that part and adjusting the time spent on other activities. Reading the room and 
making these adjustments on the fly will help maintain a productive and engaging atmosphere.

Be aware of potential pitfalls: A common mistake is spending too much time on the opening and then 
rushing through the closure. Watch the clock and keep an eye on how much time is left throughout the 
training to ensure each section receives adequate attention.

Additionally, don’t forget the use of breaks: Especially for longer trainings, well-timed breaks are essential 
for keeping participants focused and energized. Plan breaks according to the overall timing of the training 
to ensure participants remain refreshed and engaged.

In the next chapter, you will find the official training templates, where the focus shifts to the middle 
part – the expanding phase of the meeting. This is where the core content of the training unfolds, and 
where timing becomes even more crucial to maintaining engagement. As you work with these templates, 
refer back to this section to ensure that the opening and closing elements are well-integrated, creating a 
cohesive and impactful training experience.

Remember, each training is unique, and while structure is important, the true magic lies in how you 
adapt and deliver it. The timings provided are recommendations to help guide you, but the most 
important factor is how you connect with your participants and bring the Points of You® Method to life.

Introduction

Welcome to the Click & Connect Training, a powerful training designed to bring team members together 
across the organization, fostering a deep sense of belonging, visibility and value among participants. 
Whether you're using this training as a stand-alone experience or as a dynamic warm-up for a larger 
event, Click & Connect has the flexibility to meet your needs.

This training is not just about forming connections – it's about creating meaningful dialogues that elevate 
energy levels, build intimacy, and strengthen friendships within the team/organization.

As trainers, you have the opportunity to guide participants through a process that can vary in depth, 
depending on your objectives and the time available. From exploring challenges and roles to clarifying 
responsibilities and expectations, this training opens doors to expanded perspectives and insightful 
revelations. There will be moments when participants might even share something personal about 
themselves, offering a unique opportunity to get to know each other from a new angle.

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the Click & Connect template. This template is versatile, 
enabling you to adapt it to various organizational settings and goals. We'll also share an example of how 
we utilized this template to onboard our new Business Trainers, helping them define their visions and 
expectations for their roles.

Example Session: Onboarding New Business Trainers

In our session, we employed the Click & Connect template as a dynamic approach to welcome you, 
our newly-appointed Business Trainers. This engaging session kicked off exploring different perspectives 
on our expectations in the upcoming roles. The session culminated in a creative activity where each 
participant crafted a vision board. This creative process provided a tangible and visual means for 
participants to map out their aspirations and establish clear intentions for their professional journey 
ahead. 

The objectives of the session were:
-  To take a time out and bond with fellow participants from around the world.
-  To build clarity around the expectations of your new role as a Points of You® Business Trainer.
-  To bring your vision of this role to life.

Detailed Activity Flow for a Face-to-Face Setting:

Your experience was in the online setting that you can useas an example for your own online trainings. 
Below you can read the structure of the activity in a face-to-face Setting. Be aware that small parts differ 
in the online setting due to logistics. Taking inspiration from the structure mentioned above, the following 
detailed flow outlines the steps of the Activity:

Introduction to the activity:

-  Spread the Materials: 

Before the pause, participants opened their ClicKit materials. Now, the Photo Cards are ready for use. 
For more details, refer to Chapter 5 – Pause.

-  Generate Excitement: 

Begin by creating a high-energy atmosphere to spark enthusiasm for the upcoming activity.

-  Simple Rules: 

Before we start and choose our first Photo card, I want to share two important rules to remember 
during the process:
–  No good cards or bad cards – it’s only a perspective, what you hear from others is also a 

perspective, be open to listen and take from it whatever is precise for you.

–  Rule of the Deck  – at any time in the process you can change any of your cards, you don’t need to 

ask for permission, only ask yourself why am I changing it.

-  Introduce the Activity's Focus: 

Inform participants that today’s session will explore their roles as Points of You® Business Trainers. Let 
them know that this is also a chance to meet and connect with new people from all over the world, 
providing opportunities to inspire and learn from each other. Then, ask them to select a Photo card 
that resonates with their perception of this role.

-  Simplify the Set-up: 

Once everyone has selected a card, instruct participants to return the remaining Photo cards to their 
journal pocket.

[ 108 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesClick & Connect

Table of Contents  >

-  Observe the Photo Card: 

Imagine what might be just beyond the frame of the photo.
If this scene were a video on pause, what do you imagine happening in the next 10 seconds?

Ask participants to observe their chosen Photo card and reflect internally on a series of questions:
–  What is the first thing you notice?
–  Are the colors vibrant, or is it black and white? How does this choice in color speak to you?
–  Describe what you see in simple terms.
– 
– 
–  What might have occurred just before this moment was captured?
–  How does this image make you feel, honestly?
If you could alter something in the photo, what would it be?
– 
–  How does this Photo connect to your role as a Business Trainer?
–  Alternatively your participants can also place their Photo cards in their ClicKit journal on page 5. 

-  Journaling Time:  

Give participants a minute to write in their journals their first observations that came to their mind 
about their new role. Their thoughts, feelings, what came to them from observing the card.  

-  Find your partner: 

Encourage participants to maintain the thoughts and emotions triggered by their Photo cards and 
invite them to find a partner. Emphasize choosing someone they are less familiar with to broaden 
perspectives. Once a partner is chosen, they should take their journal  with the goodies inside of the 
pocket and ther Photo card.

Round 1 – Sharing in Pairs

-  Establishing Connection: 

When you have found your partner, sit in the 'dyad' position, meaning knee to knee, eye to eye. 
Adjust your sitting distance to ensure comfort for both.

-  Determine Roles: 

Decide who will be Person A and Person B.

-  Person A's Turn:

–  Person A will take 5 minutes to respond to the question: 
–  “What are my expectations in my new role as a Points of You® Business Trainer?”
–  Cover aspects such as personal expectations, desired achievements, and anticipated professional 

and personal growth.

–  Person B should actively listen, ask for clarification if needed, and mainly focus on understanding 

Person A's perspective.

-  Time Management:

–  Person A should utilize the full 5 minutes for sharing – this is not a race who finishes first.
–  Check for any questions before starting.
–  Play the Sharing playlist (Apple Music | Spotify) during the sharing time and announce when 1 

minute remains.

-  Person B's Turn:

–  After thanking Person A for their sharing, it's now Person B's opportunity to share their thoughts on 

the same question.

–  Continue the playlist as Person B speaks.

-  Story Break: 

After both partners have shared, we give a small “break” by sharing a story. Read "Dialogue" from the 
Speak Up Book (page 32) to the group.

-  Crafting Empowerment Messages: 

Participants then use their memo notes to write a short, empowering message to their partner, inspired 
by what they've heard. Allow 1 minute for writing. Participants should keep their messages private for 
the moment.

[ 109 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesClick & Connect

Table of Contents  >

-  Message Exchange: 

After writing, allocate 2 minutes for partners to exchange the gifts they prepared for each other, in the 
form of the messages they have written to each other.

-  Transitioning: 

–  As the sharing concludes, have participants thank one another. Each participant now holds their 

photo card along with the message they've received.

–  Before moving on, invite participants to take a moment to look at their Photo card one more time. 
Ask the question that echoes in the room: “Did I connect with my expectations, and are they 
supporting me or holding me back?” Allow this moment of reflection to settle.

–  Prompt them to seek a new partner for the next round.

Round 2 – Sharing In Pairs

-  Reconnecting in Pairs: 

Everyone should pair up in the 'dyad' position as before. Take a moment to decide upon roles, 
determining who will be Person A and Person B.

-  Exchange of Photo Cards: 

Partners A and B switch their Photo cards, so each person is holding their partner's card.

-  Observing Photo Cards:

Invite the participants to observe the Photo card they've received. Following the same structure as in 
round 1.

-  Sharing, starting with Person B:

–  Person B begins this round by reflecting on the prompt:  

“What I think is expected from me?”

–  Consider the expectations others may have of you in your role and what you believe you need to 

contribute.

–  You may also choose to connect this reflection with the story or insights shared during the first 

round, linking it to the Photo card from earlier.

–  Allocate 5 minutes for Person B to share, followed by Person A's turn to share for 5 minutes.
–  The Sharing playlist should continue in the background, and inform participants when they have 1 

minute left to share.

-  Discussion on Expectations and Support: 

With both partners having shared, discuss how expectations can potentially lead to disappointment, 
particularly during challenging times.

-  Finding a Question:  

After hearing from each other, have participants select a Question card intended to offer support to 
their partner when they are going through difficult moments in this  role  or any challenge they might 
encounter.

-  Reviewing the Question Card: 

Give participants 2 minutes to share with each other the Question cards they selected for them and 
their  message. It’s a gift they are receiving on this journey to support them.

-  Closing the Sharing Session:

–  Upon completion, participants should offer thanks to their partners.
–  Before regathering, invite participants to take a moment to reflect. Ask the question that echoes in 
the room: “In what ways do my expectations and my partner's meet, and how does this create a 
connection?” Allow a brief pause for participants to consider this connection before moving on.
–  Each person now has their partner's Photo card, a Question card, and the empowering messages 

from Round 1.

–  Regathering as a Group: Finally, have everyone reconvene in the larger circle to proceed with the 

next round.

Integration Before Round 3 

-  Journal Reflection: 

Encourage participants to reflect on their new role and expectations – both their own and those 
perceived from others. Guide with questions to probe deeper insights:
– 
–  How can you bridge this gap to align both areas?
–  How do the insights received today connect with your view on your new role? 

Is there a gap between your expectations and what is expected from you?

-  Encouraging Group Sharing: 

Open the floor for participants willing to share their reflections and breakthroughs. Handle moments 
of silence with patience, highlighting that sometimes waiting facilitates voluntary sharing. 

-   Trainer tips: 

To promote a sharing culture without forcing participation:
–  Remind that sharing is caring and can enhance individual processing of insights.
–  Assure added value in collective reflections and learning. 

-  Continuation After Sharing: 

Aim to have 3-4 participants share their insights to foster a rich group dialogue. Adjust the number of 
participants sharing on your training timing.
Continue to the next round.

Round 3 – Vision Board

-  Preparation: 

Spread out the colorful markers and pens around the room during Round 2 sharing if you 
haven’t done so before. 

-  Vision Board Instructions:

Invite the participants to take their ClicKit sets we will be working with the whole set now 

– 
–  Task is to create a Vision Board of them in  their new role as a Business Trainer.
–  Explain: The assignment is to create a visual representation of how they see their role. Integrating 
the expectations from themselves and what they think others expect from them. Even though it’s 
the beginning of the journey it’s the step to create some clarity and intention for ourselves. A road 
map of where they want to go.

-  Activity Time:

–  Give participants 15 minutes to work on their vision boards.
–  Suggest spreading out in the room to find a comfortable workspace.
–  Play the Creating Playlist (Apple Music | Spotify) music to maintain energy and focus.

-  Time Check and Closure:

–  Notify participants when there are 5 minutes remaining.
–  Gather everyone back in a circle to conclude the vision board activity.

Focus & Action

For the Details of the Focus and Closure Building Blocks please see the respective chapter. Below is the 
Focus & Action adaptation for the Click & Connect Process:

-  Journal Reflection: 

Dedicate 5 minutes for participants to write in their journals about,their creative process and feelings 
while making the vision board. Their current feelings about their role after this visual exercise. Some 
guiding questions for Reflection:
–  How was the experience of creating your vision board?
–  How do you feel looking at your vision board now?
–  Has your perception of your role changed or solidified? 

-  Sharing Vision Boards: 

Open the floor for voluntary sharing of vision boards
–  Encourage participants to describe their creation, feelings, and reflections.
–  After sharing, each participant gives a title to their vision board.
–  Continue until 3-4 people have shared, reinforcing the value of shared insights. 

-  All Participants Title Their Vision Boards: 

After sharing, prompt every participant to title their vision board, even if they didn't share publicly. 

-  Action Steps: 

Immediate Action: Something they can achieve within the next 24 hours.

Guide everyone to identify three actions to bring their vision board closer to reality:
– 
–  Short-Term Goal: A slightly larger goal to accomplish in 7 days.

-  Training Closure: 

Acknowledge the collective effort and progress, marking the official end of the training.

Timing Adjustments

Our Activity is designed with flexibility to cater to your needs, whether you have a concise hour or an entire 
day. Below are some guidelines on how to adjust the recommended flow based on your available time:

-  If your session duration is closer to 60 minutes, prioritize the core elements of the flow. Given 

the time constraint, consider omitting Round 2 and the group discussions to maintain a focused, 
uninterrupted experience for journaling and utilizing the ClicKit. This streamlined session will engage 
participants in the most crucial aspects without feeling rushed. 

-  For sessions lasting between 60 and 120 minutes, you'll have the opportunity to delve a bit deeper. 
Use the additional time to facilitate brief sharing after journaling, allowing participants to voice their 
reflections and insights. This will encourage a more interactive and enriching training while still 
keeping within a manageable timeframe. You can easily follow the flow of the session 

-  Should you have the luxury of a full-day training, embrace the complete flow. Here, not only can 
you incorporate extensive group discussions, but you can also allot additional time for participants 
to share and journal. This extended interaction deepens the training experience, fostering richer 
conversations and more profound personal reflection.

Regardless of session length, our aim is to create a transformative experience. Adjust the flow to fit your 
allocated time, and be assured that whether it's a brief encounter or an all-day immersion, the training 
will be impactful.

Online Setting:

If you are facilitating the training online, here are some important notes to consider. For more general 
information about online facilitation, refer to the relevant chapter.

Logistics:
Ensure that you have sufficient time to send out materials so that participants receive their ClicKit sets. 
We recommend sending the same ClicKit set to each participant to make card exchanges easier.
Before the session, inform the participants to have colorful markers on hand to use during the vision 
board round 3.

Round 1:
Participants will be randomly paired by the meeting platform, removing the choice of partner. Present this 
as similar to drawing a card face down – you won’t know who you’ll meet.
After the first round of sharing, bring participants back to the main meeting room. Read the story and 
ask participants to prepare a message for their partners. Then, reopen the breakout rooms for message 
exchanges.
Do not play any music while participants are in the breakout rooms.

Round 2:
Follow the same process as in Round 1. After sharing, gather participants in the main room to select a 
question, then return them to breakout rooms for further sharing.
Again, no music should be played while participants are in the breakout rooms.

Round 3:
Play a playlist while participants create their vision boards to maintain high energy during the process.
Continue to support participants by holding space for them as they work.

Introduction

Welcome to Team Fusion, a dynamic training designed to unlock the full potential of a team by 
harmonising individual strengths and fostering seamless collaboration. Tailored for groups eager to 
elevate their collaboration, Team Fusion melds personal and collective growth within your organization.

This training embarks on a profound journey to the core of effective teamwork. Far beyond mere 
coexistence, it reveals the power of a truly interconnected unit, where every member’s distinct talents 
fortify the team's collective success.

As trainers, you will play an instrumental role in guiding teams through an enlightening process. This

challenging, this training is designed to push the boundaries of traditional collaboration, inviting teams to 
explore and establish a foundation for genuine cooperation.

In this section, we introduce the Team Fusion framework – a thoughtfully crafted methodology to boost 
team performance through strategic collaboration and mutual understanding. 

Introduction to Personas

In this Training, we use the concept of a Persona to help participants explore their roles within the team. 
The term "Persona" comes from the work of Carl Jung, who used it to describe the outward face or mask 
that individuals present to the world. According to Jung, the Persona is not the entirety of who we are, but 
rather a role we play based on societal and situational expectations.

Why use a Persona in Team Training?

The Persona allows us to look at how we consciously choose to behave within a team or group, 
reflecting the aspects of ourselves that we present to others. In a team setting, the Persona represents the 
behaviours, mindsets, and actions that individuals project to achieve collective goals. It’s a useful tool 
for self-reflection because it helps us observe how we navigate team dynamics, balance individual and 
collective needs, and how we contribute to the team’s success.

By using Personas in this training, we encourage participants to:

-  Understand their role in the team as shaped by their thoughts, emotions, and actions.
-  Observe the difference between their inner self (their authentic values and feelings) and the Persona 

they project to the team.

-  Consciously refine their Persona so that it best supports team collaboration and aligns with the team’s 

objectives.

The Persona is not static – it changes based on context and interaction, giving us the flexibility to adapt to 
the team’s evolving needs.

In this training, participants will have the opportunity to explore their Persona in relation to the team 
and observe how it interacts with other Personas. Through this process, they will sync their roles and 
contributions with the team’s goals, leading to greater cohesion and success.

Example Session: 

In our session, we employed the first two parts of the Team Fusion template to explore your Persona in 
working within a small group. While we are still in the early stages of forming as a team, this process 
helps us move toward building strong connections and effective teamwork for the future. Since we 
haven’t worked together long enough yet, we did not proceed to the phase of creating the links that bond 
us together.

Below you will find an example of the session that can be led in a face-to-face setting for a team that is 
during their connection stage of the team development. The objectives of this session were:
-  To meet each other as a team
-  To observe my Persona within the team, refining how it aligns with the team’s needs.
-  To synchronise and integrate the team’s Personas, ensuring they work together effectively to achieve 

the team’s goals.

Detailed Activity Flow for a Face-to-Face Setting:

Introduction to the activity:

-  Spread the Materials:

Before the pause, participants opened their ClicKit materials. Now, it’s time to have the ClicKit in front 
of us, with all the stickers, markers that we have.

-  Generate Excitement:

–  Start by saying: We will be exploring how we behave and interact as part of a team – how our 

actions, thoughts, and behaviours align with our roles and the goals of the team. This is a chance 
to see how our individual Personas contribute to the team’s collective success.

[ 123 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

–  Remind the team of their shared goal: It’s also crucial to keep in mind the goals of the team. As 

we move forward, let’s remember that our individual efforts must come together to support those 
objectives. Today is about discovering how we can synchronize our strengths to achieve the team’s 
shared vision.

– 

Invite Participation and Encourage Involvement: As we go through this process, we encourage you 
to speak up and be involved. This is your chance to shape the team and the way you work together. 
You may find yourself stepping out of your comfort zone to approach things a little differently, and 
that’s a good thing. By pushing your boundaries, you can unlock new ways of contributing to the 
team’s success.

–  PR for the Process – Building Patience and Long-Term Value: This process goes beyond just today’s 
session. It’s important to be patient with the process, as the insights and connections we build 
today can continue to evolve long after the training. The work we do together here will set the 
foundation for stronger teamwork and collaboration going forward. You’ll have the tools to keep 
this process alive and thriving, long after this session ends. 

-  Simple Rules:

We are going to work with each other and interact around various topics. What you hear from others 
may offer new perspectives, and it’s important to remain open to different views. This is an opportunity 
to learn not only about ourselves but also about how we behave within the team context.

Be open to listening, and take from it whatever resonates with you. You don’t have to agree with 
everything, and there’s no need to fight, prove, or justify your way of thinking. Simply remain open to 
the different perspectives shared.

-  Pre-Activity Reflection:

Before we begin creating our Personas, take a moment to reflect and journal about your role in the 
team. As you write, think about how you currently perceive yourself in the team, your contributions, 
and how you interact with others.

While the participants are journaling ask additional questions to deepen their reflection:

-  How do I typically behave in the team?
-  What mindset do I bring to team discussions or challenges?
-  What am I known for in the team?
-  What strengths do I bring to the team?
-  How do I contribute to achieving the team’s goals?
-  What do I need from others to work effectively?
-  What do others expect from me in our collaboration?
-  From 1-10 how close i am to my authentic self during teamwork
-  Who do I commit more to the team or to myself?
-  How do I act in this team, is it my typical role or do I act differently here?

-  Introduce the Activity's Focus:

Inform participants that today’s session is about observing how we work together in this team. The 
goal is to understand each other better, not only who we are but also what we need from others and 
what others need from us. This will give us insight into how we can support and collaborate more 
effectively.

Round 1 – My Persona

-  Introduction 

In a moment, I will invite you to create your own Persona of you in the team. By "Persona," I mean 
a representation of yourself in the team, encompassing not only your role but also how you think, 
feel, and act within the team. We’ve chosen the concept of a Persona because it allows for a broader 
understanding of who you are beyond just one role – it includes your mind, body, and heart in the 
team.

As we begin this activity, I invite you to think about all the elements that make you who you are in the 
team. We will create something abstract that represents the figure or person you are within the team.

-  Creation

–  You now have 15 minutes to create your Persona. We invite you to engage in a free-flow, creative 

process. We do encourage that you include some form of a body, a figure that symbolizes how you 
think, feel, and act within the team.

–  Take your time with this process. You have 15 minutes, so don’t rush. Reflect on the different 

aspects of your Persona and how they connect to your role within the team. Think about the details 
and nuances that make you unique, and add elements that represent these traits.

–  Using the different elements provided in your ClicKit set, along with your markers, design your 

Persona in a way that feels authentic to you. You can explore various forms, colors, and shapes to 
express the unique combination of mind, body, and heart that you bring to the team.
–  Check if everyone understands what you mean by Persona and if there are any questions.
–  Feel free to let your creativity guide you as you create something that reflects how you contribute 

to the team dynamic.

–  Play the Creating Playlist (Apple Music | Spotify) music to maintain energy and focus

[ 125 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

-  Observation

-  Before we dive deeper, take a moment to observe your Persona. Look at it closely, and in your 

journal, reflect on the following:
–  What do you see? How does this Persona look like for you?
–  We invite you to be curious like you are seeing this Persona for the first time. What can you say 

– 

about this Persona?
Is there something dominant that stands out to you – a theme or a common thread that runs 
through all parts?

–  What is your "punctum" – the part of your Persona that’s drawing your attention, asking for 

more focus?

–  How do you feel about how you’ve expressed yourself through this Persona?
– 

Is this Persona a reflection of who you are today, or does it represent an idealized version of 
yourself?

Spend a few minutes exploring these questions in your journal before we continue.

-  Now let’s observe deeper. I invite you to find the area that represents the head of your Persona. This 
part represents your thoughts and mindset – how you approach challenges, process information, 
and what expertise you bring to the team.
–  Where is the head of this Persona? What expression do they have? Where are they looking?
–  What mindset do they bring to the team? And point to where you are seeing this in the Persona.
–  What knowledge or skills do they contribute to the team’s success? Where do you see it in your 

Persona?

–  What thoughts hold them back from being their  best self in the team? 

Once you’ve reflected, write down on a Memo Note:
What is the strength of this Persona in the area of the Head?

-  Now, let’s move to the Center of your Persona, which symbolizes your core values, your purpose, 
emotional energy, and strengths. This is where your motivation and passion lie – how you engage 
with the team from a place of purpose. Reflect on these questions:
–  How is it represented in your Persona? What are the dominant colors? What can you say about 

the Centre of this Persona?

–  Looking at the Persona, what motivates them in this team?
–  What allows them to belong to the team? Where do you see it in the Persona
–  What drains their energy while working in the team? 

After reflecting, write on a Post-it:
What is the added value I bring to the team in this area?

-  Lastly, let's focus on the feet and hands,which  represent how you take action, move things 

forward, and connect with others in the team. Reflect on the following:
–  Does this Persona have hands and feet? What do they represent? Are they moving or still?  

How do they move?

–  What steps do they take to accomplish their tasks?
–  How do they help the team move forward? Do they have a superpower?
–  What do they avoid doing in the team? Can you identify it on the Persona?

After reflecting, write on a Post-it:
How do I want this area to be? What change can I do to better support the team?

[ 126 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

-  Adaptation  (5 minutes)

Now that you’ve observed and reflected on your Persona, take around 5 minutes to make any changes 
or adjustments. Feel free to adapt your Persona to better align it with who you are now and how you’d 
like to contribute to the team moving forward.

Round 2 – Introducing our Personas

-  Introduction:

We will now take the opportunity to introduce ourselves through the Personas we’ve created. This is 
a chance to see how others perceive our contributions to the team and gain insight into how we are 
seen.

Before we begin, it’s important to build encouragement for everyone to participate. Remember, this is 
about perspectives – what we see in the Persona, not what we think about the person. As we share, 
focus on what we observe visually in the Persona and how it represents the strengths the person brings 
to the team. It’s also an opportunity to observe how you feel when receiving feedback – there’s no 
right or wrong, just different perspectives.

Let’s make sure we focus on strengths, pointing out what stands out in the visual representation, and 
share with a spirit of openness and support.
Ask for a volunteer to start, and once you have one, proceed with the sharing.

-  First Person’s Turn (approximately 7 minutes per person):

-  Observations from the Group (5 minutes): The first person will present their Persona without speaking 
initially. The group will observe the Persona and share their thoughts. Invite the group to discuss:

[ 127 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

–  What do you observe about this Persona?
–  What strengths do you see that this Persona brings to the team?
–  When a strength is shared, encourage participants to be specific about where they see it in the 

created Persona – focus on the visual representation.

Allow 3-4 people to share their observations. If the same individuals are consistently sharing, 
encourage others to speak to ensure a variety of voices are heard.

-  Persona Owner’s Reflection (2 minutes): Now, the person who created the Persona will share their 

thoughts:
–  What main insights do you have from observing your Persona?
–  What do they feel they bring to the team through this Persona?

-  After the first person finishes, move on to the next person, following the same process until 

everyone has introduced their Persona.

-  Collection

After everyone has shared, invite participants to take a moment to reflect on their Persona in light of 
what they heard from the group. Ask them to journal on the following:
–  The insights and feedbacks they received during this sharing round.
–  Do I want to take on this Persona?
–  What price am I paying for taking on this Persona?
–  What do I gain from being this Persona?
–  How does this Persona impact my team dynamic?
–  Are there any small changes or refinements I want to make to my Persona based on what I heard?

Allow 2-3 minutes for them to make any final changes to the Persona, to represent their part in the 
team.

[ 128 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

Round 3 – Team Persona

-  Introduction:

In the previous rounds, we created our Personas individually, each representing how we see ourselves 
in the team – our mind, body, and heart. Now, we are going to bring these Personas into action and 
explore how they interact together as a team.

This part of the training is about understanding how we connect and collaborate as a team. We will 
now come together to create a Team Persona – a collective representation that integrates all of our 
individual strengths and contributions. This Team Persona will symbolize how we, as a team, align our 
unique qualities to support and fulfill the team’s goals.

-  Connecting the Personas:

Participants will have 15 minutes to use their Personas and the additional materials (string, tape, etc.) 
to create a visual representation of how their Personas connect and work together as a team.
–  Task: The team is tasked with representing how their Personas connect in a way that reflects how 

they collaborate to achieve their shared objectives.

–  Encourage Reflection: Ask participants to think about the strengths of their Personas and to bring 

these strengths into the connections they create. This may feel natural for some, while others might 
find it a new challenge.

–  Materials: Use the provided materials – string, tape, and markers – to attach Personas and 

symbolize connections. Each connection should reflect how individuals work together and support 
one another in the team.

–  As the Trainer, observe the process, taking note of how participants make decisions, who takes the 
lead, and how they communicate. This process should represent where the team is now, but also 
keep in mind that their goals may evolve over time.

-  Two Tracks for Facilitating the Process:

–  Track A: Smooth Process 

If the team is working well and everyone is participating effectively, allow the process to flow 
naturally. Let them complete their creation and proceed to the debrief when ready.

–  Track B: Challenging Process 

If the team is struggling – whether there is disagreement, conflict, or lack of participation – pause 
the activity and take a time out. Facilitate a short session to address what is happening. Use the 
following guiding questions:
-  Who wants to share about the process? (start with this one)
-  How do you feel about the process?
-  Do you have any observations about the team in this process?
-  What’s happening right now in the team?
-  What are the barriers to collaboration that you’re noticing?
-  How are different members contributing, or holding back?
-  What can we do as a team to move forward together?

This reflection should help the team refocus and better understand the dynamics at play. Afterward, 
resume the activity and encourage the team to continue creating their Team Persona. 

-  Debrief (at least 45 minutes):

Once the team has completed the activity, gather everyone for a group discussion. It's best to stay 
near the Team Persona to maintain a sense of connection to it. This is an opportunity to reflect on 
the process and explore how the connections they created align with the team’s objectives. Some 
questions to guide the conversation (in bold we marked the questions that always work) :

[ 129 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

–  How was the process for you?
–  Who are you connecting with, and why? What is the nature of the connection you’ve created with 

others?

–  How was the process of creating these connections? Did it feel natural, or did you have to adapt 

your Persona in any way?

–  Were you acting in alignment with your Persona, or was it different in the group setting? If it was 

different, why do you think that happened?

–  How do these connections support the team’s goals? Reflect on whether your Persona is 

contributing to the team’s objectives and where adjustments might be needed.

–  Do you feel aligned with your Persona during the process? Was there a need to adapt to the group 

dynamic, and if so, how did you adjust?

–  Is there anything you would change or add to your Persona to better align with the team? What 

final changes or additions would help your Persona better support the team’s goals?

-  Purpose of the Debrief:

The purpose of the debrief is to provide space for participants to reflect on their experience and share 
insights about how the creation process unfolded. This is an opportunity for the team to:
–  Observe how the process felt for them: Was it smooth or challenging? What dynamics emerged 

within the group?

–  Explore the connections they’ve made: Understand the significance of these connections in the 

– 

context of the team’s goals.
Identify any personal or team-wide adjustments: Encourage participants to recognize areas where 
they may need to adapt their approach for greater team cohesion.

As the Trainer, your role during this debrief is to:
–  Facilitate discussion in a way that allows participants to express their thoughts openly.
–  Observe and guide them to deeper insights about how they collaborated and contributed to the 

team’s objectives.

–  Highlight growth opportunities and areas where the team can improve their dynamics moving 

forward.

–  By doing so, you help the team solidify their learning and ensure that the reflections are not just 

abstract thoughts, but practical insights that will support their future collaboration.

–  Additionally, your role is to hold space for the group, especially if the process was challenging 
and emotions like frustration or anger surfaced. It's important to acknowledge and name these 
emotions, reassuring participants that it's okay to feel them.

–  Finally, ensure the debrief ends on a high note by bringing everyone together and leaving 

participants feeling empowered. Acknowledge their efforts and progress, and encourage them to 
carry these reflections forward.

However, if the outcome of the process reveals challenges within the team – such as tension, 
frustration, or disengagement – this is an opportunity to understand where the team currently stands. 
Reflect on what these challenges reveal about the team’s current dynamics and discuss what they may 
need to work on to move forward.

In some cases, if the team is going through a crisis or intense conflict, it may be necessary to 
recognize that this particular process might not be suitable at this time. The key is to remain adaptable 
and aware of what the team needs to grow and progress.

Focus & Action

For the Details of the Focus and Closure Building Blocks please see the respective chapter. Below is the 
Focus & Action adaptation for the Team Fusion Process:

-  Reflecting on Persona and Collaboration

After the team activity, bring everyone together to shift the focus inward – this is a time for personal 
reflection.

Invite participants to reflect silently on their Persona, with a specific focus on how they can 
collaborate more effectively as part of the team. Guide their reflection with the following prompts:
–  How does my Persona support the team’s objectives?
–  What specific qualities or strengths do I need to bring from my Persona to help the team succeed?
Is there an aspect of my Persona that I need to adapt to improve my collaboration within the team?
– 

Give participants a few minutes to consider these questions and gather their thoughts before moving 
on to the next step.

-  Summarizing Insights – Giving the Persona a Title:

Next, invite participants to summarize their insights by distilling their thoughts into one word or a 
short phrase – a title for their Persona. This title should reflect the essence of who they are in the team 
after everything they’ve learned during the session. Ask them to write their titles on their Personas 
before gathering back in the circle to close the session.

-  Action: 

Give participants some time to write down reflections and insights in their journals before moving on.
After reflecting, ask each participant to define one individual action item that they will commit to 
based on their insights. This action item should focus on:
–  How they will contribute to team success by leveraging the strengths of their Persona.
–  What they can improve or adapt to better align with the team’s needs and goals.

Encourage participants to take this action item seriously, as a personal commitment to help the team 
move forward.

-  Closure:

Conclude the session by acknowledging the progress made during the training. Reinforce the 
importance of continuous collaboration and remind the team that applying the action items will help 
them grow and achieve their goals more effectively.

Thank the team for their participation, and emphasize that the insights gained today will help them 
build a stronger, more cohesive unit.

Timing Adjustments

Our Team Fusion activity is designed with flexibility, allowing it to fit within various schedules, whether 
you have a concise session or a full-day experience. Below are guidelines to help you adjust the flow of 
the training based on the time available:

For shorter sessions (under 2 hours):
If your session is less than 2 hours, we recommend focusing on Round 1 – My Persona and Round 2 – 
Introducing Personas. These rounds help participants reflect on and share their Personas, emphasizing 
strengths and contributions to the team. However, skipping Round 3 means the session will focus more 
on individual introductions rather than developing true team dynamics or fully engaging in the team 
fusion process.

For sessions closer to 2 hours, we recommend that only skilled facilitators proceed with the full process. 
Managing the time will require sharp facilitation to guide participants through the deeper team dynamics 
effectively. It’s a fast-paced environment where every minute counts, and you’ll need to be precise to 
highlight the most important insights without losing the flow. This approach requires confidence in the 
process and a deep understanding of how to extract key moments from a shorter discussion.

For longer sessions:
The more time you have, the more space you create for in-depth discussions and group interactions. With 
additional time, you can dive deeper into the dynamics of the group through Round 3 – Team Persona, 
where participants explore how their individual Personas connect and collaborate as a team. This 
extended engagement allows for reflection not only on individual strengths but also on how the team can 
enhance its collective effectiveness.

Even a full-day session can be highly beneficial, as it provides ample time for the team to work through 
each round thoroughly, leading to a richer exploration of how their Personas integrate into the team’s 
collective dynamic. The more time available, the greater the opportunity to address the crucial aspects 
of team cohesion and explore the deeper dynamics that emerge in Round 3 – Team Persona. If time is 
limited, the session may not 
fully capture the important, 
more intricate aspects 
of how the team works 
together, which are vital for 
long-term success.

Anchoring the Experience: Your Role as a Trainer

The true magic of this template lies in the hands of the Trainer. Unlike the structured nature of Click & 
Connect, the Trainer in this process plays a much deeper role, leading the team in a way that profoundly 
shapes the experience. How you observe, contain, and reflect the team’s dynamics will determine how 
far the process goes. 

Observation and Reflection: The Trainer’s Role

As the Responsible Adult, you are there to observe and reflect what is happening in the room. You must 
be attuned to both spoken and unspoken dynamics, such as body language, energy shifts, and emotions 
that may not be fully expressed. Your role is not to provide answers but to act as a mirror, helping the 
team see themselves and their dynamics more clearly.

It’s essential to bring empathy into your observations. You should be sensitive to how the participants 
feel – whether they are engaged, hesitant, or frustrated – and adjust your approach accordingly. When 
participants introduce their Personas, ensure the conversation focuses on genuine strengths. If humour or 
mockery creeps in, gently intervene to guide the team back to serious reflection. Encourage participants 
to interact with the visual elements of the Personas and ask them to identify where they see the qualities 
they’re discussing.

Challenging and Guiding: Asking the Right Questions

As the Leader, you guide the team by asking thoughtful questions and gently challenging their 
perspectives. Your role is to foster curiosity and help participants explore deeper insights, rather than 
providing answers. The goal is to encourage open dialogue that supports the team’s growth, without 
creating complexity where it doesn’t naturally exist.
For example, during the debrief, you can invite the team to reflect on the process:
-  Who do you feel naturally took the lead?
-  Who do you feel was less involved?
-  On a personal level, you can ask: Who feels they led? Who feels they could have been more 

involved? 

Alternatively, you can guide them to reflect on the team Persona they’ve created:
-  What do the physical arrangements signify?
-  Why are some participants grouped closer together than others?

In this role, it's also important to gently challenge the team when necessary. If you notice tension or 
disengagement, bring it to light with empathy and courage. The more willing you are to reflect on these 
unsaid dynamics, the deeper the process will go, while always focusing on promoting positive team 
growth.

[ 134 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTeam Fusion

Table of Contents  >

Holding Space: Containing Emotions and Team Dynamics

As the Container, your role is to hold space for the team’s emotional journey. This means creating an 
environment where all emotions – joy, frustration, anger – are acknowledged and normalized. You must 
ensure that the team feels safe to express themselves fully, knowing that their emotions will be contained 
without judgement.

In moments of intensity, you act as the team’s anchor. Whether the team is navigating uncertainty, 
discomfort, or heightened emotions, you provide the stability they need to explore these dynamics. Your 
presence allows participants to lean on you for support while encouraging them to move through their 
emotions toward resolution.

Part of being the container also means accepting that the process may not always be smooth or 
predictable. As the Trainer, you must be comfortable with different outcomes, and prepared to guide the 
team through both easy and challenging moments. Make sure that every voice is heard, and reflect back 
any disengagement or tension to the team with care and neutrality.

Trusting Your Intuition: The Key to Anchoring the Process

Finally, across all of these roles – Responsible Adult, Leader, and Container – your intuition and 
experience will guide you. Trust your instincts about when to challenge, when to step back, and when 
to hold space. The process will only go as deep as the team is ready to go, but your ability to observe, 
reflect, and contain their experience will be key to facilitating lasting change.
By holding space with empathy, leading with courage, and being the stable anchor for the team, you 
can create a powerful, transformative experience. The magic is truly in your hands – guide the team 
confidently, knowing you are shaping an experience with the potential for lasting impact.

Adjustments for Different Stages of Team Development

This template is adaptable to the various stages of team development. Read more about it in Chapter 2 – 
Stages In a Team’s Development. Below are adjustments that can be made to align with each stage:

1.  Connection:

-  At this stage, teams are still getting to know one another. Facilitation should focus on building trust 
and creating openness. Encourage participants to share openly, helping them establish a strong 
foundation of connection.

-  Provide clearer guidance in reflections and discussions, as the team may not yet feel fully 

comfortable addressing deeper or challenging dynamics. To further enhance bonding, you can 
guide the team to create a team manifesto based on their team Persona. This manifesto would 
represent their shared values, goals, and vision, serving as a guiding principle for how they work 
together as they continue to develop as a team.

2. Individuation:

-  During the storming phase, tensions and conflicts are more likely to arise. As a Trainer, be attuned 

to unresolved issues and tensions.

-  Guide the team to confront discomfort head-on, encouraging honest discussions about frustrations 
and disagreements. It’s important to ensure that every voice is heard and that conflicts are not 
avoided but explored in a safe space.

3. Reciprocity:

-  In the norming phase, the team is beginning to work more harmoniously. Facilitation should now 
aim to reinforce positive behaviors and encourage reflection on how the team can continue to 
build upon their growing collaboration.

-  Provide opportunities for more self-led reflection, with you acting as a support, while staying 

mindful of any underlying tensions that may need to be addressed.

4. Completion:

-  In this high-functioning stage, the team operates smoothly, and your role as a Trainer is to help 
them prepare for upcoming changes. Focus on how they can further enhance their agility to be 
ready for any future challenges or transitions.

-  While the team may feel they are in a good place, encourage them to continue reflecting on areas 
for growth, ensuring that no important issues are overlooked. Help the team solidify their strengths 
while also staying adaptable for the road ahead.

The Culture Compass

Welcome to the Culture Compass Training, a transformative experience designed to help participants 
connect their personal values with the core values of the organization. In today's fast-evolving workplace, 
understanding and articulating an organization’s values and DNA is crucial for fostering cohesion, 
enhancing collaboration, and building a distinct identity that resonates both internally and externally. 
This Training will guide you through a reflective process, helping you align your own guiding principles 
with those of the organization, creating a unified vision for future success.

The Culture Compass is not just about identifying values; it’s about ensuring that these values are lived 
and embodied in every aspect of our work. By the end of this Training, participants will have a clear 
understanding of their personal values and how they connect to the organization’s goals, paving the way 
for clearer communication, stronger partnerships, and long-term resilience.

At the heart of this training is the belief that personal values are deeply interconnected with the culture of 
an organization. When these values are aligned, they foster greater clarity, distinction, and strategic focus.

The Culture Compass process focuses on:
-  Crafting a cohesive code of values that guides your actions and decisions.
-  Strengthening internal communication by aligning personal values with organizational goals.
-  Building partnerships across teams by fostering shared understanding.
-  Enhancing your organization’s market identity by ensuring that values are lived out authentically.
This alignment doesn't just bring internal cohesion; it also amplifies your organization’s distinct identity 
in the marketplace, setting the foundation for long-term success.

The Importance of Values

Research consistently shows that aligning personal and organizational values has a profound impact on 
both individuals and the organization. According to Person-Organization Fit Theory, when employees' 
values align with the company’s, they are more motivated, engaged, and committed. This leads to higher 
job satisfaction, better performance, and stronger retention.

Moreover, Self-Determination Theory highlights that individuals who experience autonomy and 
alignment between their personal values and organizational culture tend to experience greater wellbeing, contributing more meaningfully to the success of the organization. A shared sense of values builds 
trust, strengthens communication, and leads to more cohesive teamwork, all of which are essential for 
navigating today’s competitive business landscape.

By connecting your personal values to the organization’s core principles, you are contributing to a more 
engaged, motivated, and aligned workplace culture.

Why the Culture Compass Training Matters

As trainers, you will lead participants through a powerful process that helps them uncover the deeper 
connections between their personal values and the organization’s values. This Training fosters authentic 
dialogue, reflection, and the identification of concrete actions that will help individuals embody both 
their personal values and the organization's principles in their day-to-day work.

The Culture Compass is designed to be flexible and adaptable, whether used as a stand-alone session for 
aligning values or as part of a broader strategic training or workshop. From shaping how team members 
collaborate to refining how your organization communicates its identity in the marketplace, this training 
offers valuable insights and practical steps for sustained growth and success.

Example Session:

In our Culture Compass Training, we invited you, our Future Business Trainers, to explore how  
Points of You® values can be integrated into your own training practices. The session focused on aligning 
personal values with organizational values to deepen the trainers’ understanding of how they can 
authentically live and deliver these values in their sessions. Being the face of Points of You® to your 
clients.

This example outlines a face-to-face session designed for trainers who are seeking to strengthen their 
alignment with the organization's core values. The purpose of this session is to help participants 
experience the process of linking personal values with team or organizational values, allowing them to 
embody these values in their work.

While this session assumes the presence of organizational or team values, later in this chapter, we will 
provide an adaptation of Round 2 for situations where organizational values are not yet defined.

Objectives of the session:
-  To reflect on Leading personal value and explore how it serves me in my professional life. 
-  To integrate how my Lead Value links to Points of You® DNA.
-  To develop strategies to embody and live out these values in my professional life.

Introduction to the Process

-  Generating Excitement and Setting the Context:

Welcome everyone to the Culture Compass Training, where we will embark on a journey of 
connecting our personal values to our organization’s core values. Today’s session is designed to help 
you reflect on your own guiding principles and how they align with the mission and values of our 
organization. By the end of this session, you will have a clearer understanding of how your unique 
strengths contribute to the collective success of our team.

-  Why Values Matter:

Before we dive in, let’s talk briefly about why values are so important. Values are the principles that 
guide our decisions, actions, and how we interact with the world around us. They shape who we are 
as individuals and define what matters most to us in our personal and professional lives.
Research shows that aligning personal values with organizational values leads to greater engagement, 
satisfaction, and commitment. When our personal values resonate with those of the organization, we 
feel a stronger sense of belonging and purpose in the work we do. According to Person-Organization 
Fit Theory, individuals who experience this alignment are more motivated and perform better, because 
their work feels meaningful and aligned with who they are.

-  Introducing the Activity’s Focus:

Today, we’ll be working with Photo cards to help bring out the values that resonate with you on a 
personal level. We’ll then explore how these values align with those of the organization. Trust your 
intuition as you go through this process – there are no right or wrong answers. The first things that 
come to your mind are usually the most meaningful, so give yourself the freedom to explore and 
reflect.

-  Simple Rules of the Process:

Before we begin, let’s go over a couple of simple rules to guide us through the activity:
–  Trust Your Perspective: Every card you choose, every story you share, is your perspective. There's 
no right or wrong answer – just your experience. Be open to hearing the perspectives of others as 
well.

–  Rule of the Deck: If at any point during the activity you feel the need to change your card, you 

don’t need to ask for permission. Just ask yourself, Why am I changing it? and trust your intuition.

-  Warm-Up - Identifying Key Values:

–  To get us started, let’s do a quick warm-up activity to begin thinking about values on a broader 

level. We’ll share a list of some common values, and I’d like you to take a moment to choose your 
top three values that resonate with you most in your professional life. 

–  For example the Dare to Lead Values by Brene Brown
–  We will be using Mentimeter or a flipchart for this exercise. As you choose your top three values, 

we’ll display them and gather a collective list of the most important values in the room.

–  Trainer Tip: Use Mentimeter to gather the results live, or ask participants to mark their top three 
values on a flipchart or whiteboard. As the results come in, we’ll highlight the most common 
values chosen.

-  Moving Deeper - From the Mind to the Heart:

What we’ve just done is a great exercise for engaging our minds. But now, we’re going to go 
deeper – into our hearts and experiences. In the next part of the session, we’ll explore values in a 
more personal and intuitive way by reflecting on a moment where you felt you were at your best 
professionally. Through this, we’ll mine the personal values that guide you in your daily actions and 
decisions.

[ 143 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

-  Preparing for the Next Steps:

Now that we’ve set the stage, we’ll move into using photo cards to help uncover the values that 
resonate with you the most. Remember, this is a time to trust your instincts and be open to whatever 
arises in the process. Let the cards speak to you, and we’ll guide you through how to connect these 
values with the organization.

Round 1 -  My Lead Value

-  Guided Imagery Process:

–  Establishing Connection: Before we dive, I invite you to close your eyes and take a few deep 

breaths. Allow yourself to relax into this moment, leaving behind any distractions or worries from 
today. Let your body settle into a comfortable position, and let your mind become fully present 
here, in this space.

–  Guided Imagery: Now, I want you to take a journey back in time. Think of a moment in your 

professional life when you felt at your absolute best – a time when you were proud of something 
you did, and your actions led to a meaningful outcome. Maybe it was a big achievement or a small 
moment that made a huge impact. Focus on this memory. 

–  Give time for participants to find this memory before continuing.
–  As you recall the experience:

-  Where were you?
-  Who was involved?
-  What happened?
-  What did you do that led to the outcome you are proud of?
-  How did it make you feel at that moment?
-  How does it feel to recall it now?
-  Hold this memory in your mind, remember the actions you took and how they aligned with 

who you are at your core?

Take a few more moments to relive this memory fully, feeling the emotions, the energy, and the pride 
that came from this experience. When you are ready, slowly open your eyes 

-  Journaling:

Take 3-5 minutes to write down the key details of this moment. Use the following questions to guide 
your journaling:
–  What was the situation?
–  What did you do to make it successful?
–  How did your actions influence the outcome?
–  How can you name what supported you in this action?
–  What personal strengths or values guided you through this moment?

-  Partner Sharing:

Now that you’ve reflected on your story, we will move into pair sharing.
Find a partner and decide who will be Person A and Person B.

-  Person A's Turn:

–  Person A has 5 minutes to share their story with their partner.
–  Describe the situation, what you did, the outcome, and why this moment made you feel proud.
–  Person B: Your role is to listen with all your senses. Focus fully on what Person A is saying. Don’t 

interrupt or ask questions – simply listen. While doing so write down on your memo-note, 
words that title the values that you hear in this person. Around 5 values that you pick up (values, 
characteristics, the essence of the story)

[ 144 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

–  Once Person A has finished sharing: Person B will choose a photo card from their ClicKit, a card 

that resonates with the story they just heard.

–  Person B then takes 2 minutes to explain their choice:

-  Why did you choose this card?
-  What values or strengths did you see in Person A’s story and give the memo notes with your 

words. 

-  Switch Roles:

–  Now, Person B shares their story, and Person A listens.
–  Person B has 5 minutes to share their story of a moment where they felt at their best professionally.
–  Person A listens without interrupting.
–  Once Person B has finished: Person A selects a photo card that best represents what they heard 

and the words on memo notes.

–  Person A then shares why they chose this card and the words they wrote, for 2 minutes.

-  Second Turn: New Partner, New Sharing:
–  Now, it’s time to find a new partner.
–  Once again, decide who will be Person A and Person B.
–  Repeat the same sharing process:
–  Each person takes turns sharing their story for 5 minutes.
–  The listener selects a photo card and writes down 3-5 words on a memo note, explaining their 

choice.

-  Closing Round 1:

–  By the end of this round, each participant will have received two photo cards and two memo notes 

from their partners, reflecting on the values or qualities their partners saw in them.

–  Reflection:

-  Take a moment to look at both photo cards and the words your partners shared with you. Think 

about the story you shared and what you heard.

-  Take a few minutes and write to yourself: What was new for you in the conversation or the 

photo that you received? Has something changed in the way you see the value that emerged 
from your story? Do you know this value in other examples of your work?

-  From the two photos you received, choose one photo card that resonates most deeply with you 

and represents the essence of your story.

-  Reflect on this card and give it a name – a single word or phrase that represents The Lead Value 

that guided you in the moment you shared.

-  Place the Photo Card on the left hand side of the handout and write the Title of your Lead Value 

below.

We will move forward into the next round with this photo card and value in mind.

Round 2 -  Resonating Organization Value

-  Introduction to Organizational Values:

Now that we’ve reflected on our personal values and shared stories of moments where we felt 
professionally at our best, we are going to take a step forward and explore how these values align 
with our organization’s core values.

-  Establishing Connection:

We believe that when personal values align with organizational values, it strengthens our connection 

[ 145 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

to the work we do and creates a more purposeful, impactful experience. In this next step, we will 
explore how your personal stories relate to the values of our organization.

-  Presenting the Organizational Values:

–  Take a moment to listen carefully as we share the core values that drive our organization. These 
values represent the foundation of who we are, what we stand for, and how we engage with the 
world.

–  Share each organizational value one at a time. For each value:

-  Read the Official Description: Share the formal definition or description of the value as it’s 

written by your organization.

-  Show a Visual Representation: Provide a photo or visual symbol that reflects the essence of the 

value. This adds a deeper layer of understanding for the participants.

-  Pause for Reflection: After presenting each value, give participants a moment to reflect on how 

the value resonates with their story.

-  Reflection on Organizational Values:

–  Connecting Personal and Organizational Values: Spend a few minutes reflecting on the story you 
shared in Round 1. Consider the following questions as you make the connection between your 
personal experience and our organization’s values:
-  Which organizational value aligns most closely with the actions, qualities, or strengths I 

demonstrated in my story?

– 

-  How did I embody this value in that moment?
Journaling: Take 2-3 minutes to write down your reflections on how your personal story connects 
to an organizational value. Capture the value that resonates most and how it connects to your 
actions or the outcome you achieved in your story.

[ 146 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

-  A Note on Non-Resonance:

– 

It’s also important to note that in some cases, participants may not feel a strong connection 
between their personal story and any of the organizational values presented. If this happens, it is 
perfectly okay for them to leave the connection blank.
Encourage participants to trust their instincts:
-  If none of the values resonate with the story they shared, they can leave the section blank and 

simply reflect on their own personal value.

-  It’s important to respect that not every story will have a clear alignment, and that space for 

non-connection can also lead to valuable insights. However encourage not to align with the 
concrete story but the essence and the sources-values of their actions. It doesn't have to be the 
core but a sub value that can be found in the essence.

-  Choosing a Photo Card:

–  Now that you’ve reflected on which organizational value best aligns with your story, it's time to 

express this connection visually.

–  Choosing the Photo Card: You have one Photo card left  from the previous round. You can choose 
either this one if it resonates with the organizational value you've chosen, or you may choose a 
different Photo card that better reflects the value.

–  Place the photo card that represents your connection to the organizational value on the right-hand 
side of your handout. Beneath the photo card, write the organizational value that you’ve chosen.

-  Closing Round 2:

By the end of this round, you will have visually represented your personal and organizational values 
side by side. This step helps to bridge the gap between your individual contributions and how they 
align with the company’s mission and values.
We will now transition into our next phase, where we’ll begin discussing how to live out these values 
more intentionally in our roles.

Round 3 -  Bridge

-  Introduction to Round 3:

In this round, we will work together in small groups to build a bridge between your personal values 
and the organizational values you chose in Round 2. The aim is to discover specific behaviors that 
allow you to embody both values in your work and actions.

-  Grouping by Organizational Values:

–  You will now be divided into small groups of about 3 participants, each based on the organizational 

value you selected in the previous round. This ensures that each group is focused on a specific 
value, creating a meaningful conversation around how to live out that value within the organization.

–  This group will focus on how your personal values can still support the organization’s mission 

and overall goals. You’ll explore how your unique values can complement and enhance 
the organizational values and contribute to the collective success. Discover if there is any 
commonality between the participants in the group.

–  For those who didn’t connect with any organizational value in Round 2, you will form your own 

group. In this group, you will explore how your personal values can still support the organization’s 
mission and goals, while also discussing any potential blocks or challenges you feel might exist 
between your values and the organization's values. The goal is to identify ways to overcome 
these blocks and find areas where your unique values can contribute to the organization’s overall 
success and to connect with the organization.

–  Divide the participants according to the chosen values.

[ 147 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

-  Discussion Structure:

You will have 20 minutes per group. Here’s how the discussion will flow:
Individual Sharing: Each participant will have 3-4 minutes to share:
– 
-  Their personal value they identified in Round 1.
-  The organizational value they connected with in Round 2.
-  Why this organizational value resonates with their story and actions.
-  How do these two values connect?

–  Group Discussion: After all participants have shared, spend 10-15 minutes discussing and 

brainstorming behaviors that can bridge the personal and organizational values. Discuss behaviors 
that answer the following questions:
-  What actions or behaviors can we take to live out both our personal value and the 

organizational value in our work?

-  How can we reflect these values in our training delivery or marketing strategies?
-  How can we incorporate these values into our daily interactions with colleagues, clients, or 

participants?

-  Using the Handout - Writing Behaviors on the Arrows:

–  Once you return from your group discussions, take a few minutes to reflect and write down your 
thoughts. On your handout, you will see arrows between the personal value (on the left) and the 
organizational value (on the right). This is where you will write down the behaviors that connect 
these two values.

–  Write down 2-3 specific behaviors that connect your personal value to the organizational value on 

the arrows in the center of your handout.

–  These behaviors should be actionable steps or practices that help you live out both values in your 

work.

-  Trainer Tip:

–  Encourage the groups to think practically but also creatively about how to embody both values in 
their day-to-day activities. Remind them that these behaviors don’t need to be complex – they can 
be small actions that make a big impact.

–  Reflect specifically on how these values and behaviors can enhance the training experience (e.g., 
making sessions more engaging, fostering deeper connections) or marketing efforts (e.g., creating 
authentic, values-driven communication).

–  When participants are sharining in the groups continue with the Sharing Playlist (Apple Music | 

Spotify)

-  Closing the Round:

–  By the end of this round, each participant should have a clear understanding of specific behaviors 
that bridge their personal values and the organization’s values. These behaviors will serve as the 
actionable steps that help you live out both values in your daily work.

–  Next, we’ll move on to Focus & Action stages to close this trainig.
 –

Focus & Action

For the Details of the Focus and Closure Building Blocks please see the respective chapter. Below is the 
Focus & Action adaptation for the Click & Connect Process:

-  Journal Reflection:

We’ve come a long way in today’s training, connecting our personal values with the organization’s 
values and identifying actionable behaviours that bridge both. Before we move into sharing and final 

[ 148 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

action steps, take a few minutes to reflect in your journal.
Dedicate 5 minutes for participants to journal on the following:
–  What were the main insights you gained during the discussions about linking your personal and 

organizational values?

–  How did it feel to identify specific behaviours that reflect both your personal and organizational 

values?

–  Which behaviour or action do you feel most excited or motivated to live out in your work?

-  Sharing Insights:

Give the space for participants to share their reflections. This is a valuable moment for participants to 
verbalize their insights and strengthen their connection to the values.
– 

Invite one participant from each value group to share their reflections on how they plan to live out 
the organizational value they connected with.

–  Encourage them to describe the behaviours or actions they identified and how they feel about 

embodying these values in their daily work.

–  Trainer Tip: Encourage at least one person from each value group to share to ensure that different 
organizational values are discussed, creating a sense of shared understanding and connection 
across all groups.

-  Action Steps:

–  Now that participants have reflected on the link between personal and organizational values, it’s 

time to turn those reflections into concrete action steps.

–  Guide participants to identify three specific actions that will help them live out the behaviours they 

identified in Round 3. 

–  Trainer Tip: Encourage participants to write down these action steps on their handout, so they leave 

the session with a clear, tangible plan.

[ 149 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

-  Training Closure:

–  As we close the session, acknowledge the collective effort and shared insights that have emerged. 
Thank the participants for their engagement and remind them that the process doesn’t end here – 
these values are part of their ongoing journey with the organization.

–  Follow-Up: Consider follow-up sessions to deepen value alignment, such as workshops on 

integrating values into daily actions or team-specific discussions. For more ideas, refer to the 
respective chapter on follow-up training.

-  Closing Thoughts:

Reinforce that living out these values is an evolving process that will shape their personal growth and 
the organization’s culture.
Encourage participants to support each other in their journeys, offering accountability and 
encouragement as they pursue their action steps.

Round 2 Adjustment for Organizations without defined values

-  Introduction to Organizational Values:

Now that we’ve explored our personal stories and identified the values that guide us individually, 
it’s time to look at how these values can align with the broader group values. In cases where an 
organization has not yet formally defined its core values, we can use the collective wisdom and 
shared perspectives of this group to define temporary guiding values for today’s session.

In our earlier warm-up activity, we gathered and prioritized a set of values from everyone here. These 
are the values that this group feels are most important in the way we work together, communicate, 
and succeed as a team. While they may not be the formal organizational values yet, they reflect the 
collective perspective of those who are part of this organization.

-  Why These Values Matter:

By using the values we collectively identified, we are tapping into the shared beliefs and principles 
that already exist within this group. These values:
–  Represent the qualities that are most meaningful to the team at this moment.
–  Reflect what we collectively believe is important for success, collaboration, and personal growth.
–  Offer a foundation for building a shared culture, even if it is not formally defined yet.
Rationale: While these values are not the official organizational values, they give us a starting point. 
Values come from the people who embody them, and as such, we are laying the groundwork for what 
could become the future values of this organization. By working with these values, we are shaping the 
culture as we move forward, creating a cohesive environment where everyone feels connected to the 
guiding principles that influence their daily actions..

-  Presenting the Group-Selected Values:

–  We have identified the top 5 values chosen by the group earlier in our warm-up activity. These 

values reflect what this team collectively feels are the most important principles that should guide 
our actions, decisions, and interactions within the organization.

–  Take a moment to listen carefully as we introduce each value. These values will serve as a 

temporary foundation for today’s session, helping us align our personal stories with shared team 
beliefs.

–  Step-by-Step Presentation: For each of the top 5 values, the trainer will:

-  Introduce the Value: Start by sharing the name of the value selected by the group.
-  Facilitate a Discussion: Rather than providing a formal definition, open the floor to participants 

for a brief discussion:

[ 150 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

–  What does this value mean to you in the context of our organization or team?
–  How do you think this value shows up (or should show up) in our day-to-day work?
–  Encourage participants to offer their own interpretations and examples of how this value might 

manifest in their specific roles or teams.

-  Reflection on Group-Selected Values:

After discussing each value, take a brief moment for participants to reflect on their personal story from 
Round 1. Ask them to think about how this group-selected value resonates with their personal value 
and how it might align with the actions or behaviors they identified in their story.
–  Does this value reinforce the personal value you shared earlier?
–  How does this value guide you in your daily work?
Encourage participants to note down any key thoughts in their journals to help deepen their 
connection between the personal and group-selected values.

-  Choosing a Photo Card:

–  Now that you’ve reflected on which Group-Selected Value best aligns with your story, it's time to 

express this connection visually.

–  Choosing the Photo Card: You have one Photo card left  from the previous round. You can choose 
either this one if it resonates with the Group-Selected Value you've chosen, or you may choose a 
different Photo card that better reflects the value.

–  Place the photo card that represents your connection to the Group-Selected Value on the right-

hand side of your handout. Beneath the photo card, write the value that you’ve chosen.

-  Closing Round 2:

Now that we’ve introduced and discussed the shared values chosen by the group, you will take these 
values into smaller groups. This is where you will explore how your personal value connects with one 
of these shared values, and how you can embody both in your work.

Supporting Participants in Connecting Values to Behaviors and Actions

It’s common for participants to struggle with translating abstract values into concrete behaviors and 
actions. They may tend to offer vague examples such as “I will be creative,” “I will show my passion,” 
or “I will walk the talk,” but these statements remain general and don’t lead to specific outcomes. As a 
trainer, your role is to guide participants through this process, offering practical tools and techniques to 
help them move from abstract ideas to clear, actionable steps. Below are several strategies to support 
your participants:

Use Practical Examples
One of the best ways to help participants connect values to behaviors is by offering specific examples 
that demonstrate how a value can manifest in day-to-day actions. For example:
-  Value: Integrity

–  Behavior: "Being transparent in team meetings about project progress and challenges."
–  Action: "Provide a weekly update email that highlights key achievements, roadblocks, and 

solutions."
-  Value: Collaboration

–  Behavior: "Actively seeking input from all team members during brainstorming sessions."
–  Action: "Use tools like surveys or voting systems to ensure everyone’s ideas are heard before 

decisions are made."

-  Value: Empathy

–  Behavior: "Listen without interrupting during one-on-one meetings."
–  Action: "In my next meeting, I will focus on asking open-ended questions and allowing my team 

member to fully express their thoughts."

-  Pitfalls to Avoid:

Participants may stay vague and non-specific, offering action plans like “I will schedule a meeting 
soon” without a concrete timeline or detail. Instead, encourage them to set clear, measurable steps 
such as, “I will schedule a team check-in by Wednesday and outline the project’s current status.” The 
more specific the action, the more likely it will be carried out.

Ask Behavior-Driven Questions
Encourage participants to think about how their values translate into specific actions by asking targeted, 
behavior-driven questions. For example:
-  What does this value look like in action during your daily work?
-  If someone were watching you embody this value, what would they see you doing?
-  What specific actions can you take tomorrow to live out this value?
These prompts help participants focus on concrete actions rather than staying in the realm of abstract 
ideas.

Break Down the Value into Specific Situations
Encourage participants to think about different situations in their work where the value can show up. For 
example:
-  Value: Creativity

–  Ask: How can you show creativity in problem-solving? In project planning? In communication?
By focusing on specific situations, participants can see how their value applies to various aspects of their 
work, making it easier to connect it to behaviors.

Confront and Challenge with the Right Intention
As trainers, sometimes we need to challenge participants when they remain vague or avoid translating 
values into specific actions. It may feel uncomfortable for them when we repeatedly push them to clarify, 
but this is an essential part of the process.
-  Confront participants in a supportive manner, asking them to dig deeper into what their value really 

looks like in action.

-  Encourage them to move beyond abstract concepts like “I will be a better listener” and instead 

provide examples like, “In my next team meeting, I will actively ask for feedback from quieter team 
members.”

Your role as a trainer is to challenge participants with the right intention, helping them turn values into 
behaviors that lead to meaningful change. This may involve asking probing questions, even when it feels 
uncomfortable, but it’s part of the service you’re providing to help them grow.

Final Thought

Helping participants bridge the gap between values, behaviors, and actions is crucial for translating 
abstract ideas into meaningful, real-world outcomes. This way, they will be able to embody their values in 
life and avoid staying in observation mode. As a trainer, offering practical examples and behavior-driven 
questions, and challenging participants when necessary, helps ground their values in specific, achievable 
steps. The clearer they are on how to live their values, the more impactful their work will be.

Timing Adjustments

The Culture Compass Training is designed with flexibility to cater to your specific needs, whether 
you have a concise 2-hour session or a full-day training. Below are guidelines on how to adjust the 
recommended flow based on your available time:
-  For 2 hour sessions: Prioritize the core elements of the training. Given the time constraint, consider 
streamlining the presentations and discussions while still maintaining time for personal reflection 
and key value alignment. This session will engage participants in the essential aspects without feeling 
rushed.

-  For 2 hour sessions: With additional time, you can delve a bit deeper into each activity. Use this time 

to allow more sharing and reflection during group discussions, ensuring participants have the space to 
express their insights.

-  3 hours or longer: Embrace the full training flow. Incorporate extended group discussions and 

reflection time, and allow participants more opportunities to share their values and action plans. The 
extra time deepens the experience, fostering richer discussions and more thorough personal reflection.

Regardless of the session length, the aim of the Culture Compass Training is to create a transformative 
experience. Adjust the flow to fit your allocated time, and be assured that whether it's a brief encounter 
or an all-day immersion, the training will be impactful.

Online Setting:

If you are conducting the Culture Compass Training in an online environment, there are a few important 
adjustments to make for a smooth, engaging experience. Below are key guidelines to ensure participants 
can fully engage with the process, whether they are using physical ClicKit sets or the digital Speak Up 
tool.

For more general tips about online training facilitation, refer to the relevant chapter.

Logistics:

-  Using ClicKit:

If you're using the physical ClicKit sets, ensure that participants receive their materials on time. We 
recommend sending the same set to each participant to simplify card exchanges and references. Don’t 
forget to add the handout printed in A3.

-  Using Speak Up Digital:

If you’re using the Speak Up digital tool, make sure you are familiar with the platform’s functionality. 
During the training, send participants the invite link to your open meeting. At the beginning of the 
session, allocate time to walk participants through the platform’s functionality, ensuring they know 
how to navigate the digital tools for card selection, journaling, and sharing.

Round 1:

-  Partnering:

Participants will be randomly paired using the meeting platform’s breakout room feature. Present this 
as similar to drawing a card face down – you won’t know who you’ll meet, and that adds a layer of 
curiosity and surprise to the process.

-  Instructions for Breakout Rooms:

To ensure the flow of the activity is smooth, send clear instructions to participants once they are in 
their breakout rooms. Make sure they know the structure and timing:
–  Person A starts by sharing their story for 5 minutes.
–  After Person A finishes, Person B will write down 3-5 words to describe what they heard and then 

share the words with Person A for 2 minutes.

–  After Person B shares the words, they switch roles and repeat the process, with Person B sharing 

their story and Person A providing words.

–  You can send these instructions through the chat feature or broadcast a message to all breakout 

rooms during the session to keep participants on track.

-  Photo Exchange:

If using physical ClicKit sets, participants can show their selected photo to their partner by holding 
it up to the camera.
If using digital Speak Up, participants will share which photo they choose for them, later the 
participants will select the photo card of their choice in the template. 

– 

– 

– 

[ 156 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesThe Culture Compass

Table of Contents  >

-  Words of Reflection:

Instruct participants to write down 3-5 words that describe the qualities or values they heard in their 
partner’s story. They can then share their words:
–  Physically: Hold up their words to the camera.
–  Digitally: Send the message via the chat function or show their words on a shared screen.

-  Returning to the Main Room:

–  After both participants have shared their stories and exchanged words, instruct everyone to return 

to the main meeting room.

–  Allow for a short pause, if needed, for reflection or questions, and then recreate the breakout 

rooms for the second pairing.

–  Participants will then repeat the same process in the newly created rooms, sharing their stories 

with a new partner.

Round 2:

-  Staying Together:

For Round 2, participants will remain together in the main training room. This is a collective moment 
where we introduce and reflect on the organizational values that drive our team or company. To make 
this process more engaging and visually impactful, use slides to present each of the organizational 
values.

Round 3:

-  Group Discussions & Behavior Identification:

Participants will work in groups of three based on the value they selected in Round 2. Use the 
breakout rooms to facilitate these small-group discussions.

-  Digital Journaling:

– 

– 

– 

If using the digital Speak Up, participants will write down the behaviors they identified in their 
digital journals. Encourage participants to be specific about how they plan to live out these 
behaviors in their day-to-day work.
In the digital version, there will be no handout with arrows. Instead, participants will work with 
two cards in their digital journal and write the behaviors between them as a way of bridging the 
personal and group values.
In the physical version, they can write these behaviors in their handouts

-  Objective: To collaboratively identify and define core values for an organization that doesn’t have 

formal values yet.

-  Round 3 Discussion: Focus on group-based discussions to identify and define values that reflect 

the organization's DNA. Encourage participants to explore how their personal values can shape the 
collective values of the organization.

-  Example Questions:

Train the Trainer Module 1: Icebreakers & Closures

Introduction

Welcome to the first module of the Speak Up training 
program. This foundational module spans a full day (6 
hours) and can be completed either in one continuous 
session or divided into two parts. If split, we recommend 
dedicating the first half (2.5-3 hours) to icebreakers and 
following with the closures portion after a break or on a 
separate day.

In this training, we’ll focus on how to use Speak Up to 
open and close meetings effectively. Participants will 
experience and learn how to apply icebreakers and 
closures, setting the stage for meaningful, reflective 
conversations in everyday work settings.

Our goal is to equip and empower managers, many 
of whom may be new to using such tools and 
balancing busy schedules. While they may not have 
formal facilitation experience, we aim to make this 
training accessible and engaging, helping them 
understand how to incorporate Speak Up into their 
daily meetings and team interactions.
Since many participants may be unfamiliar with 
tools like these, the full-day format allows us to 
share knowledge, guide them through hands-on 
experience, answer questions, and help them 
develop confidence with Speak Up. We want 
them to leave excited, equipped, and ready to bring these practices into their work.

This training serves two key purposes:

1.  Experience the tools firsthand: Participants will explore icebreakers and closures, experiencing how 

these activities foster trust, reflection, and engagement.

2.  Learn practical integration: Trainers will teach straightforward techniques and tips to ensure these 
tools feel natural and achievable in daily meetings, helping participants adapt them to their team’s 
needs.

Speak Up was designed to address the challenges of traditional dialogue. Meetings often feel rushed, 
disconnected, or transactional, leaving little space for authentic conversations. Speak Up uses photos, 
words, and metaphors to open channels of communication, bridge gaps, and create safe spaces for 
sharing.

This full-day training will provide participants with the tools and strategies they need to engage their 
teams from the start of meetings through icebreakers and end with impact using thoughtful closures.

By-the-Book Guide for Trainers

This next section provides a step-by-step, by-the-book guide for trainers to facilitate the session with 
confidence. Each activity includes detailed instructions, scripts, and tips to help you guide participants 
through the session effectively. These instructions are designed to make the learning experience 
straightforward, meaningful, and adaptable, ensuring managers feel equipped and inspired to use 
Speak Up tools in their own meetings.

1. Welcome & Opening   (10 minutes)

Welcome, everyone, to our Train the Trainer session! We’re excited to have you here today. This will be 
a training full of hands-on experiences and practical learning. You’ll engage with the tools directly and 
explore how they can open the door to deeper conversations. It’s our goal to ensure you leave today 
feeling confident and excited to bring these tools into your daily work with your teams.

Before we dive in, let me introduce myself [ this is the space for your self introduction - see the Welcome 
Chapter for more inspiration]

In today’s fast-moving world, communication often faces real challenges. Time constraints, distractions, 
and fear of judgement can prevent authentic dialogue. As a result, meetings become rushed, 
conversations remain surface-level, and people may not feel comfortable expressing their true thoughts. 
When teams struggle with these barriers, creativity, connection, and collaboration suffer.

This is where Speak Up comes in. Speak Up helps overcome these challenges by providing a new way to 
connect through visual tools – specifically photos and words. These tools don’t just spark conversation; 
they help us see things differently by inviting multiple perspectives, making it easier to engage in open, 
meaningful exchanges.

Using photography and metaphors in conversations is powerful because they bridge the gap between 
logical thinking and emotional connection – between the heart and the mind. A single image can evoke 
memories, feelings, and ideas that words alone often can’t express. This connection between our thoughts 
and emotions helps people open up, explore new insights, and build trust.

Today’s training will be an opportunity for you to experience these tools firsthand, understand how they 
work, and explore ways to apply them in your teams. We want you to feel the impact of these methods 
yourself so you can confidently share that experience with others.

Trainer Tip:
Emphasize that the Speak Up tool goes beyond typical icebreakers. It fosters reflection and openness, 
which leads to more authentic team interactions.

2. Objectives & Sensitivity and Respect   (10 minutes)

Objectives:
Before we dive in, I want to share the key objectives for today’s training. These will guide everything we 
do, helping you understand what to focus on and how this session will benefit you in your daily work.

Our objectives are:

1.  Experience the Power of Icebreakers and Closures:

Today, you’ll engage with these tools firsthand to see how they set the tone at the beginning of 
conversations and bring closure with meaningful reflection or action at the end.

2.  Understand the Impact of Speak Up Tools on Building Connections:
  You’ll explore how photos and words work to break down barriers, create safe spaces, and foster 

genuine, open dialogue in meetings and team interactions.

3.  Develop Practical Skills to Use Speak Up in Your Daily Work:
  By the end of today’s session, you’ll feel confident leading these activities. You’ll learn how to adapt 

these tools to your team's needs and integrate them naturally into your meetings.

Sensitivity & Respect:
To create a safe, supportive environment where we can all engage fully, let’s agree on our group 
contract:.

-  What is said in the room, stays in the room:
This will help us feel safe to share openly.

-  No judgement, no expectations:

Allow yourself to explore freely – there are no wrong answers.

-  Be present:

Let’s minimize distractions. Please silence your phones and turn off notifications. Give yourself 
permission to be fully present in this experience.

-  Respect everyone’s space to share:

Let’s give space for each voice in the room. No interruptions – listen with an open mind, even when 
perspectives differ.

-  Be mindful of emotions:

Some activities may evoke unexpected emotions. Let’s hold space for each other and practice 
empathy if strong emotions arise.

Trainer Tip:
Invite Reflection: You can ask participants: "What else do we need to feel safe and engaged in this space 
today?" This allows them to contribute additional guidelines that matter to them.

3. Introducing Points of You® & Speak Up   (10 minutes)

At Points of You®, everything we do is about the power of perspectives. Our name reflects this 
philosophy: it’s spelled ‘Points of You,’ but it sounds like ‘Points of View.’ This dual meaning is intentional 
because we believe that there are infinite perspectives on every person, object, and experience.

Each of us sees the world through our own unique lens, shaped by our experiences, beliefs, and 
emotions. In any situation, there are multiple points of view – some we see clearly, and others we may 
overlook. By taking the time to pause, reflect, and explore different perspectives, we open ourselves to 
new ways of thinking and fresh insights.

Today’s training will encourage us to step outside our usual viewpoints. The tools we use – photos, words, 
and metaphors – are designed to help us shift perspectives and make unexpected connections. Photos 
invite us to look at things differently, words encourage new interpretations, and metaphors connect logic 
with emotion.

When we open ourselves to the many Points of View, we gain the ability to see beyond the obvious and 
uncover insights we might have missed. This is where the magic happens: when people feel seen and 
heard through these new perspectives, it builds trust and opens the door to meaningful conversations.

In today’s session, we’ll explore how these tools can help managers foster openness and connection 
within their teams, helping people engage not just with their minds, but with their hearts as well.

Now, let’s take a closer look at the Speak Up tool. It’s a tool that promotes creativity, reflection, and 
meaningful conversations. Whether you are working with a small group or a larger team, Speak Up helps 
participants express themselves in ways they might not through traditional dialogue. Key elements include:

-  Photo Cards:

At the heart of Speak Up are 30 Photo cards – each designed to ignite imagination, trigger intuition, 
and provoke meaningful dialogue. These images are intentionally open to interpretation, allowing 
participants to connect with them in their own unique way.
When we engage with an image, we activate parts of the brain responsible for creative thinking. This 
allows participants to express emotions and thoughts that might not surface through words alone.

-  Word Cards:

Complementing the Photo cards are 30 Word cards. These cards reflect workplace themes and add 
another dimension to the conversation. The combination of photos and words creates a unique way to 
connect emotions with logic, helping participants express both thoughts and feelings.
Each Word card also includes a story, quote, and question in the accompanying Speak Up 
book, allowing deeper exploration. Participants can scan a QR code on the card or refer to the 
corresponding page number in the book.

-  Question Cards:

The 30 Question cards provide powerful prompts that trigger meaningful dialogue. These cards are 
versatile – perfect for one-on-one conversations, team meetings, or group sessions. You can use them 
freestyle or follow one of the pre-built scenarios in the Dialogue Starters guide.

-  Inspirational Book:

The Speak Up book is a treasure trove of stories, quotes, and questions. It serves as a companion 
to the cards, providing inspiration and guidance on how to use the toolkit. Each card connects to a 
specific page in the book, helping participants deepen their reflection with relevant content.

[ 165 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

-  There are more components in the Speak Up toolkit waiting for you to explore, with Inspiring stickers, 

blank cards and a book that turns into the game board. 

With Speak Up, the possibilities are endless. The combination of photos, words, and questions creates a 
space where participants can connect with their thoughts, emotions, and each other.
As we move through today’s session, you’ll see firsthand how this tool inspires reflection, builds trust, and 
sparks meaningful conversations.

4. Pause & Reflection with Journal Writing   (10 minutes)

We are starting with the first step of the Points of You® Method: pause. In our busy daily lives – running 
from task to task, following up on meetings and emails – we often forget to check in with ourselves. One 
of the most powerful aspects of our Method is that it gives us permission to slow down, disconnect from 
the noise, and reconnect with ourselves.
In today’s fast-paced work environment, it’s rare to get moments like this for personal reflection.
Right now, I invite you to pause, center yourself, and engage with your thoughts. Take your journals and 
reflect on this question:

What do I want to leave outside the room?
There are many noises, tasks, and thoughts that can distract us. Take this time to reflect on what you want 
to leave outside this space – what you’d like to set aside to be fully present here.

This exercise isn’t about finding the perfect answer – it’s an opportunity to explore your mind freely, 
without judgement. Let the pen flow naturally as your thoughts arise.

Trainer Tip:
-  Use Music: Play soft, instrumental music in the background to help participants relax and focus.
-  Guide Presence: Let participants know this time is for them. "This is your moment to be with your 

thoughts – there are no wrong answers here."

-  Keep the Room Quiet: Ask participants to silence phones and minimize distractions. Encourage them 

to be fully present.

Thank you for taking this moment to reflect. Journaling allows us to connect with ourselves and create 
space for new insights to emerge. In a fast-paced world, even these short pauses can bring clarity and 
intention to our conversations. 
We are ready to begin.

5. Icebreaker Activity: "What Do I Want to Leave Outside the Room?"   (30 minutes)

A moment ago I invited you to write What do you want to leave outside the room. Now I will invite us 
to take it a step forward and to intentionally decide to leave those thoughts outside so you can be fully 
present here.
In front of you are the Speak Up Photo cards facing up. I invite you to pick one card that best represents 
“What Do I Want to Leave Outside the Room? Follow your intuition and see which photo image is calling 
you. 
Once you’ve selected your Photo card, let’s take a few moments to observe the card. I’ll ask you some 
questions and I invite you to answer them in your mind:

-  What do you notice first in the photo? What colours, shapes, or elements stand out?
-  What does the photo remind you of? If you imagine what happened before or after this moment, what 

might that look like?

-  What feelings arise when you look at this image? How does it connect to something you’d like to let 

go of today?

-  If this photo could speak, what would it say about what you need to leave outside the room?

Now that you’ve had a moment to connect with your photo, I invite you to share with us about your card 
and briefly explain what you’ve chosen to leave outside the room and why. Who would like to begin?

After each participant shares, give them a Blank card or a post-it note and invite them to write down a 
word or short phrase representing what they are leaving outside the room. Once everyone has shared, 
let’s stand up together and place our cards outside as a symbolic gesture of “parking” these thoughts until 
the end of the day. At the end of our session, you may take it back or leave it behind, depending on how 
you feel.

Trainer Tip:

-  General:

–  Encourage participants to keep their sharing brief (1-2 minutes per person).
–  After the first person shares, ask: “Shall we move to the left or right?”
–  Or allow participants to share spontaneously as they feel ready.

-  Adjustment: Group Reflection: 

After each participant shares, invite the group to briefly reflect on what they heard. Encourage them to 
suggest a word or phrase the person might write down, fostering a collective understanding.

-  Adjustment: Play with Placement:

Allow participants to choose how far they want to place their card or post-it. Some may choose to put 
it just outside the door, while others might want to keep it closer, perhaps in a pocket.

-  End-of-Day Reflection:

At the closure of the day/training, revisit the cards participants “left behind” and ask them to reflect: 
Did you let go of what you intended to leave? This reinforces the significance of the exercise and 
offers closure.

-  TTT Reminder:

Encourage trainers to mention this activity at the session’s end, reminding participants of the exercise 
and inviting them to consider how it felt to “leave something behind” and whether it helped them 
remain present throughout the day.

This was an example of an icebreaker – a simple activity to help participants clear their minds and be 
fully engaged in a session. You can use this activity at the beginning of meetings to shift the energy and 
help participants focus. Even a brief reflection like this can create a meaningful change.
Now, let’s dive deeper into the topic of icebreakers.

6. Icebreakers Module: Setting the Tone for Engagement and Connection   (10 min)

Icebreakers are powerful tools to start meetings or workshops on the right note. They help participants 
ground themselves in the moment, engage with one another, and set a positive, collaborative tone. By 
breaking down barriers and encouraging playful connection, icebreakers make it easier for participants to 
speak openly and build trust.
In this module, we’ll explore three types of icebreakers and how they can be used effectively to create 
connection, spark reflection, or focus the conversation on a specific theme."

The Three Types of Icebreakers

1.  Meeting Others:

These icebreakers are designed to help participants get to know one another and build trust. In a few 
minutes we will experience an icebreaker that also includes this component.

2.  Self-Reflection:

Self-reflection icebreakers allow participants to check in with themselves and express their current 
state of mind. These activities create a mindful space and help participants become aware of their 
emotions, thoughts, or energy levels. We just experienced this type of icebreaker.

3.  Thematic Discussions:

These icebreakers introduce the topic or theme of the session, encouraging participants to start 
thinking about it from different angles. The idea is to spark curiosity and dialogue that aligns with the 
session’s objectives. We could have changed the question in the icebreaker we just experienced to 
“What is Leadership for me? And this would be this kind of icebreaker.

What Makes a Great Icebreaker?
A great icebreaker needs to create a safe, open environment where everyone feels comfortable 
participating. Here are a few key elements to keep in mind when facilitating icebreakers:

-  Be inclusive:

Ensure that everyone feels comfortable, regardless of personality type or role.

-  Keep it brief and focused:

Icebreakers should usually last no more than 10-15 minutes (for groups up to 15 people). The goal is 
to set the tone, not take over the session.

-  Connect to the session’s purpose:

Choose icebreakers that align with the goals of the meeting or training – whether it’s building trust, 
encouraging reflection, or introducing a theme.

-  Be creative and engaging:

Use Photo, Word, and Question cards to spark curiosity and make the process fun.

-  Be Flexible:

You don’t need to include all the elements in every session. Pick one or combine parts that best suit 
your goals and time constraints.

Trainer Tip:
If time allows encourage participants to reflect on their own experiences:
-  What kinds of icebreakers have worked well for you in the past?
-  How would you adapt an icebreaker to different teams or situations?
-  What can help participants feel more willing to engage with icebreakers?

Common Pitfalls to Avoid (for Managers)
Here are some common challenges you might encounter when leading icebreakers and how to avoid 
them:

-  Overcomplicating the activity:

Keep it simple. Icebreakers are meant to be fun and easy to follow. If the instructions are too complex, 
it can cause confusion and drain energy.

-  Taking too long:

Icebreakers should last no more than 10-15 minutes. If they go on too long, the session may lose 
momentum.

[ 169 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

Table of Contents  >

-  Forcing participation:

While it’s great to encourage participation, never pressure anyone to share if they aren’t comfortable. 
The goal is to create a space where people feel invited to join, not obligated.

-  Ignoring the session’s focus:

Make sure the icebreaker connects to the goals of the meeting or training. A disconnected activity can 
cause participants to disengage."

Wrapping Up the Icebreaker Module
Thank you for engaging in this exploration of icebreakers. Icebreakers aren’t just a warm-up – they’re an 
essential part of building trust, connection, and focus.
Remember, a great icebreaker breaks down barriers, encourages participation, and creates a space where 
participants feel safe to share. Whether your goal is to build relationships, spark reflection, or dive into a 
theme, icebreakers help set the tone for meaningful dialogue. Let’s experience a different ice breaker.

7. Second Icebreaker: "What is My Superpower?"   (50 minutes)

For this next icebreaker, we’re going to reflect on our superpowers – the unique strengths that we bring to 
our work and personal lives.
As you see in the center of the room, I’ve changed the setting slightly. The Photo cards are now facedown, and I’ve placed the Word cards face-up.
Think about what your superpower is. Please pick one Photo card and one Word card that together 
represent your superpower. Take your time – follow your intuition and see which cards call to you.

Take a moment to observe the card you picked. Reflect on how the image connects to your unique 
strengths and consider these questions:

-  What details stand out to you in the photo? Is there a specific part of the image that catches your 

attention?

-  If you were to zoom out or zoom in on this photo, what else might you see?
-  What emotions arise when you look at the image? How do these emotions relate to your superpower?
-  How does the word card connect with the photo card you’ve selected? Do they align with or contrast 

each other? What new insights do they reveal together?

Sharing in Pairs
Now, I invite you to pair up. In each pair, choose who will be Partner A and who will be Partner B.

-  Partner A will begin by sharing what their superpower is, using the photo and word cards to tell their 

story. Partner B will listen actively without interrupting. You’ll have 5 minutes for this.

After 5 minutes, I will read a short story from the Speak Up book. Then we’ll switch roles, and Partner B 
will share their superpower for the next 5 minutes.

Group Sharing
Now, let’s come back together as a full group and share each other’s superpowers.
But this time, we’ll do it differently. I invite you to speak as your partner in an ‘I statement.’ So, when you 
share, say:
‘I am [your partner’s name], and my superpower is...’
Once the first partner shares, their partner will continue before we move to the next pair
Now that everyone has shared, if anyone would like to add something – either as themselves or their 
partner – this is the moment for your P.S. Feel free to share any additional reflections that arose during the 
activity.

[ 170 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

Table of Contents  >

Thank you all for sharing. This exercise not only helps us recognize our own strengths, but it also shows 
the impact of being seen and acknowledged by others.
When we hear our superpower reflected back through someone else’s voice, it strengthens our sense of 
self and helps us show up more confidently.

Now, imagine how powerful this can be for your teams – helping them discover and appreciate one 
another’s strengths. This icebreaker is a longer activity, designed for times when you’re starting a full-day 
session or multi-session program. Expect it to take 45 minutes to an hour.
When you’re beginning an intensive program, setting aside this time for participants to share on a deeper 
level will establish a foundation of trust and mutual respect. This investment in time allows for a powerful 
bonding experience, which can enhance collaboration and engagement throughout the day or program.

8. Q&A on Handling Resistance & Challenges   (30 minutes)

Thank you all for participating in the icebreakers. Now, let’s take a moment to reflect on what we 
experienced and discuss why icebreakers are such powerful tools.
Icebreakers help us do more than just start conversations – they break down barriers, create 
psychological safety, and encourage trust and openness. When used effectively, they can shift the energy 
in a room, make space for different perspectives, and foster meaningful connections.

Addressing Challenges & Resistance
Sometimes, participants may be hesitant to engage in icebreaker activities – and that’s okay. As a manager 
or facilitator, it’s important to:

-  Explain the purpose:

Make it clear why the icebreaker matters and how it connects to the session's goals.

[ 171 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

Table of Contents  >

-  Invite participation without pressure:

Let participants know that it’s okay to pass if they aren’t ready to share.

-  Acknowledge resistance:

Understand that some participants might feel uncomfortable or think the activity isn’t relevant. Your 
role is to create a safe space that allows them to engage at their own pace.

-  Adjust the activity if needed:

If resistance persists, be flexible – switch to a simpler or smaller-scale version of the activity to help 
participants ease into it.

Q&A with the Group
I’d love to hear your questions, concerns, or ideas about implementing these tools.
-  What concerns or doubts do you have about using icebreakers or closures with your teams?
-  What challenges do you think might arise when introducing these activities?
-  How do you think you can inspire your participants to engage more fully and make these activities 

meaningful?

Trainer Tip:
-  Encourage participants to express any concerns or doubts they have about introducing the tools.m
-  Create a space where ideas are exchanged, and motivation is built through discussion.
-  Offer guidance not just with examples of icebreakers but with ways to lead participants through 

resistance and ignite enthusiasm. For instance:
–  Share personal success stories of overcoming initial skepticism.
–  Highlight the long-term benefits of using these tools, such as improved team connection and trust.

Wrap Up:
As we wrap up this section, remember that icebreakers are more than just warm-ups. They help set the 
tone for trust, collaboration, and open communication, creating a safe environment where people feel 
heard.
Managers can use these tools in everyday meetings, not just workshops. Even a brief reflective moment at 
the start of a meeting can shift the energy and create meaningful engagement.

9. Break   (45 minutes) - or end of session 1

10. Transition to Closures: Importance & Integration   (15 minutes)

We’ve explored how icebreakers help us open sessions and create the right tone. Now, let’s shift to 
closures, which are equally important but often overlooked.
Closures are more than just formalities – they are moments for reflection and integration, ensuring 
participants leave with a sense of clarity and completion. A well-executed closure helps participants 
solidify key takeaways and set intentions for action beyond the session.

The Importance of Closures
Here’s why closures matter:
-  Reflection & Integration:

Closures give participants space to reflect on the experience and internalise the insights they’ve 
gained.

-  Clarity & Focus:

They help participants consolidate what they’ve learned and leave with a clear sense of their main 
takeaways.

[ 172 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

Table of Contents  >

-  Motivation & Next Steps:

A thoughtful closure inspires participants to turn insights into action, ensuring they leave the session 
with a sense of momentum and purpose.

-  Energy Management:

Ending on a positive, reflective note leaves participants feeling energized and focused, rather than 
rushed or disconnected.

Rather than just discussing closures, it’s time for you to experience a closure firsthand. We’ll now move 
into an activity that will give you a feel for how closures can bring a session full circle and create space 
for reflection and intention.

11. Closure Activity: "What Am I Taking from Today?"   (30 minutes)

Let’s wrap up where we are at this moment of our journey together. We'll do a simple yet meaningful 
closure called ‘What Am I Taking From Today?’. This exercise gives you the opportunity to reflect on your 
insights and consider how you’ll carry them forward.
We’ve spent time exploring how to use icebreakers and closures to foster meaningful conversations. 
Now, let’s reflect on what today’s experience has brought you.
In front of you, you’ll find Photo cards placed face-down. Take a moment to pick one card that feels right 
to you. This card will represent the key insight or take away you are leaving with today.
Once you have selected your Photo card, take a moment to observe the image and reflect on how it 
connects to what you’ve learned today
Now, let’s come together and share our insights. When it’s your turn, briefly tell us what your card 
represents and what you’re taking from today’s session.
Who wants to start?

[ 173 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

Table of Contents  >

Thank you all for sharing your thoughts and reflections. This activity reminds us of the importance of 
taking a moment to pause and reflect at the end of every session. 

Trainer Tip:
-  Encourage participants to keep their reflections brief (1-2 minutes).
-  Remind them that sharing is optional and that there are no right or wrong answers.

12. Debrief on Closures   (15 minutes)

As we experienced in the previous activity, closings are more than just endings. They help participants 
reflect, consolidate insights, and leave with direction. Closures can be tailored to fit the needs of the 
session – sometimes focusing on reflection and other times on concrete actions.

The Two Main Types of Closures

1.  Light & Reflective Closures

Light & Reflective Closures are a great way to close sessions quickly while still creating space for 
reflection. They help participants express how they feel or what they’re taking away in a fun and 
engaging way.

Example:
Ask participants to share a single word or sentence describing what they are taking away from the 
session. This quick exercise provides a collective snapshot of the group’s experience.

Trainer Tip:
These closures are great when time is limited or when you want to leave participants feeling light and 
energised. Use them when the focus is more on the experience rather than setting specific next steps.

2.  Action-Oriented Closures

Action-Oriented Closures push participants to move from reflection to action. These types of closures 
are powerful because they create accountability – ensuring that insights gained in the session are 
translated into real-world actions.

Example:
Ask participants to share one specific action they will take based on today’s session. This helps 
participants leave with a plan in mind and ensures that the session has a lasting impact.

Trainer Tip:
Use action-oriented closures when you want to motivate participants to act or when the session’s 
focus is on driving change or strategic planning. They’re particularly effective for team meetings or 
workshops with specific outcomes.

When to Use Which Type of Closure

Choosing between a light & reflective closure or an action-oriented one depends on the context and 
goals of your session:

-  Use Light & Reflective Closures when the goal is to consolidate feelings or emotions and leave 
participants with a sense of completion. They’re great for short meetings or informal gatherings.
-  Use Action-Oriented Closures when the goal is to motivate participants to apply what they’ve 

[ 174 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

learned or to create a plan of action. These are ideal for team meetings, planning sessions, or strategy 
workshops."

Trainer Tip: Adapting Closures to Your Team’s Needs

-  Feel the Energy: If participants seem tired or drained, a light closure might work better. If the group is 

energised, an action-oriented closure can harness that energy for forward momentum.

-  Combine Both: In some cases, it’s useful to start with a reflective closure and then move into action 

steps. For example, participants can first share a word about the session and then commit to an action.

14. Closure Activity 2: From Focus to Action   (30 minutes)

For this closure, we’re going to focus on turning insights into action. It’s one thing to reflect on what 
we’ve learned today, but real growth happens when we take concrete steps to apply our insights in 
everyday life.
I will invite each of you to select a Word card that represents your next step or commitment. This word 
will act as a reminder of your action plan, helping you stay focused as you move forward.

1.  Selecting the Word Card (2-3 minutes)

In front of you are the Word cards face-up. Take a moment to look through them and select a card that 
resonates with your next step.
The word you choose should reflect either:
–  The action you plan to take, or
–  A mindset or value that will support you in following through on your plan.

2.  Journaling and Reflection (3)

If time allows, invite participants to journal a few thoughts about their action plan before sharing. Ask 
them to reflect briefly on:
–  What specific action will I take based on today’s insights?
–  How will the word I’ve chosen help me stay committed to this action?

3.  Group Sharing (15-20 minutes)

Now, let’s come together to share:
One specific action you are committing to, after today’s session.

4.  We’ll go around the group, and each person will have the opportunity to share briefly.

Trainer Tip:
-  Encourage specificity: Ask participants to be clear and specific about their action step rather than 

sharing broad or vague intentions.

-  Check for practicality: Ensure that the action item is doable and tangible – not something theoretical, 

general, or abstract. Ask follow-up questions to help participants clarify and make their action precise, 
ensuring it’s something they can realistically implement.

Wrap-Up: Closing the Mission-Oriented Activity
Thank you all for sharing your words and commitments. This mission-oriented closure helps us bridge the 
gap between reflection and action.
Remember, small, intentional steps can lead to meaningful change. Keep your word card close – whether 
on your desk, in your journal, or on your phone – and let it serve as a reminder of the action you’re 
committed to taking.

15. Q&A on Implementing Icebreakers & Closures   (40 minutes)

We’ve explored the importance of icebreakers and closures and experienced them firsthand. Now, I’d like 
to open the floor for any questions about how you can implement these tools in your meetings or team 
settings?
This is your time to ask anything on your mind – whether it’s about handling resistance, adjusting the 
activity to fit your group, or incorporating closures into everyday meetings."

Anticipating Key Questions & Prompts
If participants need help getting started, consider using these prompts to encourage discussion:
-  "How do I manage resistance from participants?"
-  "What if someone feels uncomfortable sharing during an icebreaker or closure?"
-  "How can I adapt these activities for remote or hybrid meetings?"
-  "What strategies can I use to make closures actionable in shorter meetings?"

Trainer Tip:
If participants seem hesitant, ask specific questions like:
-  "What challenges do you foresee when introducing icebreakers to your team?"
-  "What type of closure would feel most aligned with your team’s dynamics?"

Handling Common Challenges: Trainer Responses

-  Managing Resistance to Icebreakers or Closures

It’s normal for some participants to feel hesitant, especially if they are unfamiliar with these types of 
activities. The key is to explain the purpose clearly – why the activity matters and how it connects to 
the session’s goals.
Also, invite but don’t force participation. Remind participants that it’s okay to pass if they don’t feel 
ready to share, as this helps build psychological safety over time.

[ 176 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 1

Table of Contents  >

-  Adapting for Remote or Hybrid Teams

In a virtual setting, icebreakers and closures can be just as powerful if adapted properly. You can use 
breakout rooms for pair work or small group activities and digital versions of Photo and Word cards to 
maintain engagement.
Keep virtual activities short and focused, and ensure everyone has a chance to participate.

-  Making Closures Action-Oriented in Short Meetings

When time is limited, a quick but powerful closure can be asking participants to share one action 
they’ll take as a result of the meeting. Even a brief round of ‘What’s one thing I’m doing next?’ can 
leave participants feeling focused and motivated.

Wrapping Up the Q&A Session
Thank you for your thoughtful questions. Remember that icebreakers and closures are adaptable tools – 
there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. What’s most important is that they fit your team’s dynamics and goals.
Experiment with different styles, and don’t be afraid to adjust based on the energy in the room. The more 
you practice using these tools, the more comfortable your team will become with them – and the more 
impactful your conversations will be.

16. PR & Final Words   (10 minutes)

Today’s session has been a taste of what’s possible when we use Speak Up tools in meetings and team 
interactions. But there’s so much more you can explore and adapt as you practice using these tools with 
your teams.
Remember, Speak Up isn’t just a tool – it’s a mindset shift. It’s about creating a space where people 
feel safe, connected, and motivated to express themselves fully. Your role as a manager is to foster that 
environment consistently.

Connecting to the Manager Booklet
To help you along the way, we’ve provided a manager booklet – your go-to guide for using Speak Up 
tools. Inside the booklet, you’ll find:
-  Detailed instructions for various icebreaker and closure activities.
-  Practical tips and strategies to overcome challenges, like managing resistance or adapting activities for 

remote meetings.

This booklet will be a companion for you after today’s training. Whenever you need ideas, instructions, or 
encouragement, it’s there to support you. You will receive it once you fill out the feedback form together 
with the certificate you will be able to download this booklet.

Trainer Tip:
-  Have the printed booklet with you so you can show it to participants during the session.
-  Throughout the day, highlight where the relevant content can be found in the booklet. This helps 

participants see how they can use it as a practical resource beyond the training.

PR & Experimentation
One of the best things about Speak Up is that it encourages creativity and experimentation. We want to 
invite you to try out different tools and activities in your meetings. Don’t be afraid to adapt the activities 
to suit your team’s needs – that’s where the magic happens.
Even small changes, like starting a meeting with a reflective moment or ending with a quick closure, can 
transform the energy in the room and make people feel more connected.

[ 177 ]

Encouraging Feedback & Certificates
Before we wrap up, I would appreciate your feedback to help us improve and grow. Please take a 
moment to share your thoughts on today’s session.
Once you’ve completed the feedback, you’ll receive your certificate of completion. Thank you for your 
participation and for committing to building more meaningful conversations within your team.

Trainer Tip:
-  Create enthusiasm: Highlight the practical value of the booklet to motivate participants to use it 

beyond the session.

-  Emphasize experimentation: Encourage participants to start small – try one icebreaker or closure in 

their next meeting to build confidence with the tools.

16. Final Closure: One Word to End the Day   (15 minutes)

As we wrap up today’s session, I invite each of you to share one word that represents What you are 
taking away from today. It could be a thought, an emotion, an intention, or anything that stands out to 
you.
Closures don’t always need to be complicated to be effective. Sometimes a simple and concise reflection 
is all it takes to leave participants with clarity and a sense of connection. This is just another way of 
closing the loop – quick, yet powerful.

-  Sharing One Word (3-4 minutes):

We’ll take a moment to go around the group. When it’s your turn, please share your word maximum a 
sentence. You don’t need to explain it – just say what comes to mind.

-  Creating a Flow (Optional):

–  Go in order: You can invite the group to share based on where they are seated.
–  Spontaneous flow: Alternatively, let participants share when they feel ready, creating an organic 

rhythm.

Final Words of Encouragement
Thank you all for your openness and participation today. The word you’ve shared is not just a reflection – 
it’s also an intention you can carry with you.
Speak Up is not just about the activities we do – it’s about how we close each interaction thoughtfully. 
Even a simple closure like this can create a lasting impact. Take what you’ve learned today, experiment 
with these tools, and see the difference they can make in your meetings and team dynamics.

Adjustments for Two-Session Delivery

If the training is split into two sessions, consider the following adjustments to create a smooth transition 
and reinforce continuity between the two parts.

1. Closing the First Session
To close the first session, use an icebreaker or closure activity focused on revisiting what participants 
left outside the room at the beginning. Invite each participant to reflect on how much they were able 
to “leave it outside” on a scale from 1-10. Then, ask them to consider one small step they can take to 
improve, let go further, or maintain this progress in future sessions. This helps participants end on a 
reflective note, acknowledging any progress they’ve made and setting intentions for the next part.

2. Opening the Second Session
When the group reconvenes, start with a brief check-in to see how participants have been since they last 
met. This can include an opportunity to share any insights or observations from the days in between.
Before diving back into the main content, facilitate a short pause to help participants connect with 
insights from the previous session or any personal reflections they observed in the workplace since then. 
This pause reinforces the continuity of the training and underscores the value of integrating Speak Up 
tools into daily practice, while also giving participants space to reconnect with the process.

Train the Trainer Module 2: Feedback & Assessment

Introduction

This training is part of the second module in our Train the Trainer (TTT) program, where we shift focus 
from using Speak Up for opening and closing meetings to applying it in more structured, impactful 
conversations. The goal of this module is to equip managers with the tools and skills needed to transform 
their meetings with employees – whether it’s goal setting, feedback discussions, mid-year check-ins, or yearend performance reviews – into meaningful, engaging dialogues that go beyond numbers and metrics.

Traditional, task-driven reviews can often feel mechanical and disconnected. In contrast, this approach 
focuses on building deeper connections, fostering trust, and truly listening to team members. Here, we 
are introducing managers to a new language – one that uses photographs, stories, and metaphors to 
convey important messages and inspire deeper conversations.

Our participants today are busy managers, many of whom may have never used reflective tools like 
Speak Up before. It’s crucial that they leave today feeling empowered and confident in their ability 
to integrate these tools into their everyday work. This training is designed to provide both the handson experience and practical skills needed to make this integration seamless. Most importantly, the 
techniques must be straightforward and easy to incorporate into their existing workflows.

This session serves two primary objectives:
1.  Experience the Speak Up tools:

Explore how to use these tools to foster more meaningful and authentic feedback conversations.

2.  Build practical skills for impactful feedback and assessments:

Equip managers to confidently lead end-of-year conversations and seamlessly incorporate these 
techniques into their regular management practices, such as performance reviews, mid-year 
evaluations, and goal-setting discussions.

Training Overview

-  Duration:

6 hours as one session or split into two session

-  Format:

Face-to-face using Speak Up or online using Speak Up Digital

-  Participants:

Suitable for groups ranging from 8 to 15 participants (People Managers, HR, OD & LD Specialists)

-  Materials Needed:

–  Speak Up / Speak Up Digital
–  Manager Booklet (coming soon)
–  Dialogue Starters A3 Handouts

Logistics & Tools Setup

To ensure the success of this training, it’s essential to have the right tools in place. This session is designed 
specifically for organizations that have already invested in the Speak Up toolkit, and it’s crucial that we 
simulate the types of conversations managers will be leading within their teams. For this reason, we 
highly recommend that each pair has their own set of tools to work with throughout the exercises.

Here’s what you need to keep in mind:

-  Ensuring Each Pair Has a Set

– 

Ideally, each pair of participants should have access to their own Speak Up game set. This not only 
helps them engage more deeply but also mirrors the real-life conversations they will be having 
with their team members back at work.

–  Whenever possible, use the tools that the organization has already purchased. This will make the 

training more relevant and immediately applicable.

-  Bringing Extra Tools

– 

If you have extra Speak Up games available, bring them along. The more tools each pair has, the 
more authentic and immersive the experience will be.

-  Alternative Setup: Using Centrepieces

– 

In situations where there aren’t enough sets for every pair, you can set up centrepieces around the 
room. Here’s how:
-  Arrange several stations with Speak Up cards placed at each centrepiece.
-  At each stage of the dialogue process, participants can stand up, move to a station, and choose 

the cards they need.

-  This approach adds an interactive element while still allowing participants to engage with the 

tools meaningfully.
-  Creating a Seamless Flow

–  Whether participants have their own sets or are using centrepieces, emphasize the importance of 
maintaining the flow of the conversation. Encourage participants to be mindful of time and to use 
the cards thoughtfully, even when they need to move around the room.

Trainer Tip:
Remind participants that the goal is to practice real-world conversations. Using the actual tools their 
organization has invested in will help them feel more confident and prepared to lead these dialogues 
back in their workplace.

By-the-Book Guide for Trainers

The following section provides a clear, step-by-step guide for trainers to confidently lead this session. 
Each activity is accompanied by detailed instructions, scripts, and practical tips to help you facilitate the 
process effectively. These guidelines are crafted to ensure a smooth, engaging, and adaptable learning 
experience, empowering managers to confidently integrate the Speak Up tools into their meetings.

While this guide focuses on a standard 3-hour session, you can adapt the format using different layouts 
provided in the Manager Booklet. Whether it’s a performance conversation, goal-setting, or a mid-year 
check-in, you have the flexibility to modify the approach based on the specific needs of your team. 

1. Welcome & Opening   (10 minutes)

Welcome back, everyone! It’s great to see you all here for Module 2 of our Train the Trainer series. Today, 
we’re diving deeper into the art of feedback and assessments, but with a fresh perspective.
As managers, you engage in several crucial conversations throughout the year, whether it’s setting 
goals at the beginning of the year, mid-year check-ins to assess progress, or end-of-year reviews. These 
discussions are not just about evaluating performance – they are opportunities to create a learning 
environment where feedback becomes a tool for growth.

In today’s session, we will focus on how to use feedback to foster an atmosphere of continuous learning 
and improvement. The goal is to transform these conversations into moments where you and your team 
can observe what’s working, identify areas for development, and become better at achieving your goals.
We recognize that many of us are technically equipped to deliver feedback. However, what often holds 
us back is the courage to speak up, to truly listen, and to engage in meaningful conversations. Today, 
we’ll explore how to create a safe space where team members feel heard and supported. This approach 
isn’t just about critiquing performance – it’s about fostering a culture where everyone can learn, grow, 
and reach their full potential.

By practicing this today, you will not only learn how to give feedback differently, but also how to receive 
it in a way that drives engagement and inspires continuous improvement. The techniques we cover will 
help you apply these skills across all types of crucial conversations, whether it’s setting goals, checking in 
mid-year, or conducting year-end reviews.

The Shift from Old Manager to New Manager
We’re all familiar with the traditional management approach, where the focus was solely on delivering 
results and meeting targets. The old manager operated with a top-down, task-driven mindset.
But in today’s workplace, managers are expected to do more than just achieve goals. The New Manager 
is all about listening, fostering trust, and building relationships. It’s not just about getting the job done but 
also about understanding and supporting your team members on a deeper level. Today, we’ll explore how 
Speak Up can support you in this shift – helping you become a manager who engages and empowers 
your team.

The Power of Speak Up & Using Visual Tools:
As we move through today’s session, remember that traditional dialogue often falls short because we 
focus too much on metrics and KPIs. People can feel judged, rushed, or unheard. Speak Up helps bridge 

[ 185 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

this gap by using photos, stories, and metaphors to create a space where people feel safe to share. This 
shift engages both the logical and emotional sides of the brain, making conversations more meaningful 
and resonant.

Trainer Note:
We won’t dive into detailed introductions since we’ve already connected in Module 1. Instead, let’s focus 
on re-engaging and preparing for today’s deeper conversations.

2. Objectives & Sensitivity and Respect   (5 minutes)

Trainer Script:
Before we dive into the content, let’s take a moment to set clear objectives for today’s session and create 
a safe space where everyone feels comfortable exploring these new tools.

Today, we have two main objectives:

-  To equip you with powerful skills and tools that will elevate your performance conversations, making 

them more engaging, meaningful, and impactful. 

-   To provide hands-on experience by guiding you through the process: first as a participant and then as 

a facilitator in performance conversations.

Sensitivity & Respect:
Since today’s session involves trying out new tools and approaches, it’s essential that we create an 
environment of respect and openness. We’re learning a new language – one that involves listening, 
empathy, and using visual tools to guide conversations. This might come naturally to some of you, while 
for others, it could be an entirely new experience. Let’s embrace that learning process together.

[ 186 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

Here are a few ground rules to ensure everyone feels comfortable:

-  What’s shared in this room, stays in this room:

We want to create a safe space for honest sharing.

-  No expectations, no judgement:

Allow yourself to explore without the pressure of getting it ‘right.’ This is a space for experimentation 
and growth.
-  No distractions:

Let’s silence our phones and minimize interruptions so we can be fully present.

-  Respect each other’s space:

Give everyone a chance to share and listen without interruptions.”

Trainer Tip:
If you notice participants hesitating to engage, gently remind them that this is a supportive space where 
they can explore and take risks. Encourage them to embrace the discomfort of learning something new, 
as this is where growth happens.

3. Introducing Points of You® & Speak Up   (5 minutes)

Before we dive deeper into today’s session, I’d like to introduce you to the essence of Points of You® 
and the philosophy behind it. The name ‘Points of You’ holds a deeper, intentional meaning that aligns 
perfectly with what we are exploring today.

On the surface, it’s spelled as ‘Points of You’ – Y-O-U – but if you say it aloud, it sounds like ‘Points of 
View.’ This double meaning reflects what we believe: that there are infinite perspectives on everything – 
whether it’s an object, a situation, a person, or even a conversation.

At any given moment, we each view the world through our own unique lens, shaped by our experiences, 
beliefs, and emotions. Our goal in today’s training is to tap into those different points of view to foster 
deeper connections and insights. The beauty of using tools like photos, words, and metaphors is that they 
help us break away from our usual way of thinking and open up to new perspectives.”

The Power of Seeing Things Differently: The Story of the Shoe Factory
To illustrate this idea, let me share a story. Imagine two salespeople from a shoe factory are sent to a 
remote village to explore new markets. The first salesperson reports back saying, ‘No one here wears 
shoes, there’s no market for us.’ The second salesperson, however, sees it differently and says, ‘No one 
here wears shoes yet – there’s a huge opportunity for us!’

This story shows how two people can look at the same situation and see completely different possibilities. 
That’s what we aim to do here: help you and your teams shift your perspectives and unlock new 
opportunities in conversations.

Why Feedback Conversations Matter
In traditional feedback and assessment conversations, we often get stuck focusing solely on metrics, tasks, 
and numbers. However, when we shift our perspective, we can create a space for employees to share 
their own points of view, struggles, goals, and personal stories. This shift isn’t just about listening for the 
sake of it – it's about unlocking deeper insights that can drive engagement and motivation.

The Benefit to You as a Manager:
When you understand your team members on a deeper level, you’re not just managing performance – 
you’re building trust and fostering loyalty. By using Speak Up tools to uncover these perspectives, you 
can:

-  Increase Engagement:

Employees who feel heard are more likely to be invested in their work, leading to higher productivity.

-  Boost Retention:

A manager who takes the time to understand their team members’ personal challenges and aspirations 
builds a more loyal team, reducing turnover rates.

-  Enhance Collaboration:

By appreciating different perspectives, you create a more open, inclusive environment that encourages 
creativity and teamwork.

This is where the true impact happens – when feedback conversations transform from mere evaluations 
into meaningful, trust-building dialogues that inspire growth and commitment.

Trainer Tip:
Encourage managers to reflect on the idea that every employee sees their work through a unique lens. By 
tapping into those perspectives, they can unlock a wealth of insights that not only enhance performance 
but also strengthen team morale and cohesion. Remind them that investing time in understanding their 
employees' viewpoints can lead to a more engaged, motivated, and loyal team.

4. Explanation of the Method - How to Lead a Dialogue   (10 minutes)

Before we dive into the practical exercises today, I want to introduce you to the framework we’ll be using 
throughout our session – the Points of You® Method. This is a simple yet powerful approach designed to 
help you lead more meaningful and effective conversations with your team members, whether during 
performance reviews, goal-setting meetings, or feedback discussions.

[ 188 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

In today’s fast-paced work environment, it’s easy to get caught up in the ‘what’ – the tasks, metrics, and 
targets. But we often forget about the ‘who’ – the person behind those numbers. This method is a way 
to shift that focus, helping you to connect on a deeper level with your team members and uncover new 
insights.

The Four Steps of the Points of You® Method:
We’ve developed a 4-step method that you can use to guide your conversations. This method is 
designed to bring structure to your dialogues, ensuring that they are not just transactional but truly 
transformational. Let’s walk through each step together:

1.  Pause – A Strategic Break:   

The first step is to pause – to step back from the rush and take a moment to reflect. This conscious 
pause is about breaking free from automatic thought patterns and opening up space for new insights.
Why it matters: In conversations, pausing helps both you and your team member approach the 
discussion with a clear mind, ready to listen and engage.

2.  Expand – Exploring New Perspectives:

Once we’ve paused, it’s time to expand. This step encourages stepping out of the usual mindset and 
exploring new perspectives. By examining different viewpoints, you can unlock creative solutions and 
discover hidden opportunities.
Why it matters: In performance reviews, this can mean exploring the employee’s perspective, 
understanding their challenges, and seeing opportunities for growth that might otherwise be missed. 

3.  Focus – Making Informed Decisions:

After exploring different angles, it’s crucial to focus. This step is about narrowing down the insights 
gathered and prioritizing what’s most relevant. It ensures that decisions are thoughtful and aligned 
with both individual and organizational goals.
Why it matters: This step is key in feedback conversations where you want to focus on actionable 
takeaways that can drive meaningful change.

4.  Doing – Turning Insights into Action:

The final step is doing – putting those insights into action. This is where strategy meets execution, 
turning reflections into concrete steps that drive progress.
Why it matters: A conversation isn’t complete until it leads to action. This step helps ensure that your 
dialogue with your team members translates into real-world results.

Throughout today’s session, we’ll guide you through each of these steps, helping you experience how 
they work in practice. By the end of the training, you’ll not only have practiced these skills but also feel 
confident to implement them with your team.

This structure is designed to be flexible. Whether you’re conducting an end-of-year review, a goalsetting session, or a feedback meeting, these four steps will provide a clear pathway to more meaningful 
conversations.

We’ll be practising this method in pairs today, giving you a chance to play both the role of manager and 
employee. This will help you see both sides of the conversation and give you hands-on experience with 
how to guide it effectively.

5. Pairing Up for Practice & Assigning Roles   (5 minutes)

Now that we’re moving into the practical part of today’s session, we’ll be working in pairs to practice the 
end of year conversation through the Points of You® Method. As today is about expanding perspectives, I 
invite you to pair up with someone you don’t know that well. It’s easy to stick with people we’re familiar 
with, but sometimes the most meaningful conversations happen when we connect with someone new.
Now, here’s an interesting perspective to consider: in life, we always have a choice. Right now, you can 
decide whether you want to actively seek out a partner or prefer to wait and be chosen. Both choices 
are valid, but I invite you to notice what you tend to do. Are you someone who takes the lead, or do you 
prefer to observe and wait?

This exercise is a chance to reflect on how you approach situations in general. Are you someone who 
dives in, or do you take a step back? There’s no right or wrong way – it’s just an observation about 
yourself.

Activity Instructions:

-  Pairing Up:

–  Take a moment to find a partner. Remember, try to pair up with someone you haven’t worked with 

before.

–  Once you’ve found your partner, decide who will be Partner A (Manager) and who will be Partner 

B (Employee). 

-  Clarifying Roles:

–  Partner A will take on the role of the manager, responsible for leading the conversation.
–  As the manager, Partner A will guide the dialogue, ask questions, and prompt Partner B throughout 

the exercise.

–  Partner B’s role is to respond and engage, but Person A will be the one driving the conversation. 

-  How This Will Work:

–  Throughout the exercise, I will provide instructions to Person A. Your task as Person A is to take 

charge of the process while allowing Person B to share their thoughts and reflections.

–  For example:

-  When it’s time to select or discuss a card, Person A will prompt Person B on what to do.
-  If there are specific reflections or actions required, Person A will guide Partner B through them.
In the first round, Partner A will lead the conversation, while Partner B plays the role of the 
employee. Later, you’ll switch roles so everyone gets to experience both perspectives. 

– 

-  Creating a Safe Space:

–  Take a moment to connect with your partner. This exercise is about creating a safe and open 

environment for dialogue, so let’s start by getting comfortable with each other. Once everyone is 
ready, we’ll move into the first stage – Pause.

Trainer Tip:
-  Encourage participants to spread out around the room for privacy and ease.
-  Remind Partner A to guide the conversation, using open-ended questions and reflective listening. 

Encourage them to focus on keeping the dialogue flowing naturally.

-  As you walk around, ensure each pair has enough space to engage meaningfully and that Partner A is 

taking the lead as instructed.

6. Stage One: Pause – A Strategic Break   (15 minutes)

Now that you’re paired up, we’re moving into the first stage of our Points of You® Method: Pause. This 
step is about creating space for reflection and truly listening.
In this exercise, Partner A will take on the role of the manager, while Partner B will be the employee. We 
will go through the entire year-end conversation step by step, starting with this first phase. The goal here 
is to understand the employee’s journey, achievements, and the goals they’ve set for themselves.
During the Pause stage, we want to slow down, to tune in to each other, and to create the space for a 
meaningful conversation. This is about stopping the daily rush and shifting into an observer’s mindset, 
allowing us to connect on a deeper level.

Activity Instructions:

-  Partner A (Manager):

Invite Partner B to share about their 1-2 goals that they set for the year. 

– 
–  Your role is to listen actively, being curious and open. Focus on understanding your partner’s 

journey and their reflections on their goals.

–  Give space to hear Partner B.

Let’s begin! You have 5 minutes for this conversation.

Mid-Conversation Check-In (Trainer Intervention)
After 2-3 minutes, the trainer stops the conversation briefly:
Let’s pause for a moment. I’d like to check in: Is the conversation staying on track? Are we focused on 
the goals and reflections related to performance, or has the conversation shifted to more personal or 
emotional topics?
As managers, it’s important to create a safe space for sharing, but also to gently guide the conversation 
back to its intended focus. If the discussion has drifted, use this moment to respectfully reconnect to the 
performance review goals.

[ 191 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

Trainer Tips:
-  Gentle Redirection: If the conversation drifts too far into personal territory, it’s important to guide it 

back to the performance review. Try something like:
–  That’s really insightful – let’s connect it back to the goals we’re reviewing.”
–  Thank you for sharing that. Let’s focus now on how it ties into the goals you set for this year.

-  Active Listening: Encourage managers to focus on listening with curiosity, rather than jumping in to fix 

or redirect too quickly. The pause is about giving space for the employee to express themselves.
-  Balance: Remind participants that while it’s valuable to acknowledge personal aspects, the goal of 

this exercise is to connect the dialogue to performance and goals. It’s about striking the right balance 
between empathy and focus.

-  Encourage the groups to use the whole  5 minutes to stay on the topic, if they finish earlier to sit in 

silence and just be.

-  Collect non-verbal cues such as body language and posture, as these can be important to reflect upon 

later in the process to better understand underlying emotions and engagement.

Trainer Note:
-   This pause is different from the typical Points of You® pause (i.e., closing eyes and listening to music). 
Instead, it’s a pause through conversation—a shift in energy that helps managers and participants 
become more present.

-   Emphasize that this is an opportunity to teach managers the importance of being present and actively 
listening to their team members. It’s about grounding the conversation and focusing on what truly 
matters.

Handouts & Tools Distribution:
While participants are engaged in their conversations:
-  Hand out the Dialogue Starter handout to each pair.
-  Place a set of Speak Up Photo cards with each pair. These will be used in the next phase to expand 

the conversation.

[ 192 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

7. Stage Two: Expand – Exploring New Perspectives   (20 minutes)

Now that we’ve taken the time to pause and reflect, let’s move to the next stage in our Points of You® 
Method: Expand. This phase is all about broadening our perspective, stepping out of the familiar, and 
exploring new ways of looking at a situation.
In this stage, Partner B will focus on answering the questions on the layout chart. Partner A will guide 
them through this process, using the Photo cards to bring out deeper insights.

Activity Instructions:

-  Partner A (Manager):

Invite Partner B to look at the first question: What am I grateful for?

– 
–  Afterwards invite them to choose a Photo card (face up) that best represents their response. 

Encourage them to select the image that resonates with their feelings of gratitude in their goal (if 
choose two to focus on one). What worked for them, what they accomplished, etc.

–  As a manager this is also an opportunity for you to act as a mirror, reflecting on what was shared 

and adding your own thoughts or observations in a supportive and constructive way.

–  The aim is not to direct the conversation, but rather to acknowledge and validate the employee’s 

perspective, showing that their voice is heard and valued.

-  Trainer Instruction:

–  Once you see that each pair has selected a Photo card, invite both Partner A and B to observe the 

chosen image together.

–  Let’s take a moment to observe the card. I’ll guide you with a few reflective questions to deepen 

your observation:
-  What details stand out to you in the photo? Is there a particular element that draws your 

attention?

-  What emotions or thoughts come up when you look at this image?
-  If you were to interpret this image as a metaphor, what might it symbolize in the context of 

gratitude?

-  How does this image connect to your journey and what you’re grateful for?”

Metaphors: Introducing the Power of Symbolism
Before we dive into the sharing, let’s talk about metaphors. Metaphors help us express complex feelings 
and ideas in a way that words alone sometimes can’t. They’re powerful because they connect our logical 
thinking with our emotions.
Let’s try something quick together: If I say the word ‘winter,’ what might it symbolise? (Pause for 
responses). Yes, it could mean coldness, stillness, or even a time of rest.
Now, imagine your Photo card as a metaphor for what you’re feeling grateful for. Think about what that 
image represents beyond what’s immediately visible.”

Pair Sharing   (5 minutes)

-  Partner A (Manager):

– 

Invite Partner B to share with you what they are grateful for through the chosen Photo card as a 
metaphor. Let the image guide their storytelling and add layers of meaning to your response.

–  Listen actively and use curiosity to explore the metaphor. Ask questions like, “What does that part 

of the image represent for you?” or “How does that metaphor connect with your gratitude?

–  Don’t forget to connect the conversation to the goals and the end year conversation that you are 

having.

[ 193 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

Trainer Tips:
-  Realignment: If you notice participants are feeling lost or drifting off-track, don’t hesitate to call a brief 
time-out. Gently remind them of the exercise’s purpose and bring their focus back to the current step. 
Explain what we are doing, give an example, monitor what is happening inside of the room.
–  Tip: “If the conversation has strayed, take a moment to pause, breathe, and reconnect with the 

question at hand. It’s okay to realign and take a moment to refocus.”

-  Encourage Use of Metaphors: Remind managers that metaphors are a tool to unlock deeper insights. If 

someone struggles, suggest they think of the image as a symbol and ask what it could represent.
-  Encourage managers to use phrases like, “What I’m hearing is…” or “I noticed that…” to provide 

feedback that feels more like a reflection than a critique. This approach helps build trust and openness 
in the conversation.

Continuing Stage Two: Expand – Diving Deeper into Reflection   (12 minutes)

Now that we’ve explored gratitude, let’s move deeper into reflection by looking at:
-  What is it time for me to leave behind? 

Reflect on behaviours, thoughts, projects, or people that contributed to your professional journey this 
year, but that you would like to release in order to make space for new growth.

-  What are my expectations for the next year? 

Consider your professional goals for the coming year, as well as areas you’d like to focus on or develop.

This is an opportunity to release what no longer serves you and to identify the areas you’d like to focus on 
in the upcoming year.
You will work through the next two questions on your own, at your own pace. Remember, this is your 
time to reflect deeply, so take it step by step.

You now have 12 minutes to work through these two questions with your partner. Use the Photo cards 
to guide your reflections and storytelling. Partner B, as you share, use the images as metaphors to 
express your thoughts. Partner A, remember to listen deeply, ask clarifying questions if needed, and 
provide supportive feedback. When working on the second question use the Photo card to also give your 
feedback to your employee.
Take your time to move through both questions. You’re in control of how you divide your time between 
the two reflections.

Trainer Intervention (Mid-Conversation Time-Out):
Let’s pause here for a moment. Now that you’ve heard your partner’s reflections, let’s take this opportunity 
to deepen the exchange.

Instructions for Trainers:
-  Reflect Back as a Manager:

–  Summarize what you’ve heard to acknowledge your partner’s perspective.
–  Act as a mirror, showing you’ve truly listened.

-  Using the Photo Cards for Feedback:

–  Option 1: Reflect using your partner’s chosen card, linking their insights to the image.
–  Option 2: Select a new Photo card to offer as a symbolic gift, indicating what they might leave 

behind or focus on.

-  Encourage Empathy:
-  Frame feedback constructively, aligned with your partner’s goals.
-  Use prompts like:
-  What resonates with you here?
-  How does this image connect to what we discussed?

[ 194 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

Trainer Tip:
Focus on supportive, empathetic feedback that guides rather than critiques. Encourage managers to foster 
a safe, positive space for dialogue.

Final Reflection on the Set of Cards   (5 minutes)

Once you’ve gone through both questions, take a moment to look at all three Photo cards you selected 
Observing all three images together can reveal new insights and connections.
Consider:
-  How do the three cards align with each other?
-  What themes or patterns emerge?
-  How do these images together tell the story of your past year and your vision for the next?”

Trainer Tip:
-  Walk around and check in with participants, ensuring they are making progress and staying focused.
-  Remind participants to be mindful of the time but not to rush the process – encourage a steady, 

reflective pace.

-  Encourage managers to consider how this exercise could be applied in their own performance 

reviews, fostering deeper, more meaningful conversations with their teams.

-  If at any point you notice participants getting off track or appearing confused, call for a brief time-out. 

Gather everyone’s attention to realign them with the process and guide them back on track.

Tools Distribution:
While participants are engaged in their conversations:
-  Before moving into the next phase, discreetly place the Speak Up Word cards and Speak Up books 
beside each pair. This ensures participants have all the resources they need to seamlessly continue 
their reflections and conversations.

8. Stage Three: Focus – Identifying the Main Insight   (10-12 minutes)

In the Focus phase, we shift from exploration to identifying what truly matters most. This step is about 
identifying the core insight that will serve as a guiding light moving forward. By narrowing down to one 
key takeaway, participants can focus their energy on making meaningful changes that align with their 
goals.
The idea behind this phase is to distil all the reflections, thoughts, and discoveries from the previous 
stages into a single, powerful insight. This insight should feel like a “lightbulb moment” –  something that 
truly resonates with the employee and can serve as a focal point for future actions. It’s about clarity and 
commitment.

-  Partner A (Manager):

– 

Invite your partner to reflect on everything you’ve discussed so far. What is the main insight or key 
takeaway they are walking away with? What’s the one thing that stands out as most meaningful for 
them?

–  Once they have identified their main insight, invite them to select a Word card that captures this 

insight. Use the Word card to articulate your reflection.

–  Your role is to guide your partner in clarifying their insight. Ask questions to help them get more 
specific and precise. Encourage them to reflect on why this particular insight is so significant.
–  Use the Speak Up book if needed. You can read a story, quote, or question related to the Word 
card your partner has chosen. This can add layers of meaning and inspiration to the reflection.
–  Remember, your goal is to support your partner in turning their insight into something actionable 

and clear. Help them put their thoughts into words by reflecting and paraphrasing, making it easier 
for them to articulate and capture their key takeaways.

Now that we’ve explored gratitude, what to leave behind, and future expectations, let’s focus on 
identifying the one key insight that stands out for you. This insight should capture the essence of 
everything you’ve reflected on so far.
Partner B, take a moment to think about what truly resonated with you. What’s the one thing that you’re 
taking away from this conversation? Once you’ve identified it, pick a Word card that represents this 
insight.
Partner A, your role is to guide your partner. Help them dig deeper and clarify their insight. You can use 
the Speak Up book for added inspiration – whether it’s reading a relevant story, a thought-provoking 
quote, or a question that connects to the Word card. This can enrich the reflection and make it even more 
powerful.

Trainer Tip:
-  Encourage participants to be specific. The insight should be clear.
-  Walk around the room and check in with pairs to ensure they are staying focused and making 

progress.

-  If you notice participants getting stuck, prompt them with questions like:

–  “What does this insight mean to you personally?”
–  “How can this insight guide your actions moving forward?”

9. Stage Four: Doing – Turning Insights into Actions (10-12 minutes)

We’ve now explored reflections, identified key insights, and it’s time to move into the final stage: Action. 
This phase is where ideas turn into tangible steps. The focus here is to transform the insights gained 
during the conversation into specific, actionable commitments that can be carried forward into daily 
work.
In the Action phase, we encourage participants to take their insights and transform them into clear, 
concrete actions. The goal is to ensure that these commitments are practical, achievable, and aligned 
with their personal and professional growth. Remember, the more specific the action, the easier it will be 
to follow through.

-  Partner A (Manager):

– 

Invite your partner to identify one concrete action they can commit to that will help bring that 
insight to life?

–  Guide your partner to ensure their action step is clear, achievable, and aligned with their goals.
–  Ask clarifying questions to make sure the action step is not too vague or abstract. Encourage your 

partner to commit to something measurable and time-bound.

We’re now in the final stage of our conversation – Doing. This is where we take everything you’ve 
reflected on and turn it into something practical. Partner B, think about the key insight you identified 
earlier. What’s one specific action you can take to bring this insight to life?
Partner A, your role is to guide your partner in refining their action. Make sure it’s clear, actionable, and 
aligned with their goals. 

Trainer Tip:
-  Encourage specificity: Ask participants to be clear and concrete about their action step. Focus on 

defining an action item that will directly support their performance for the upcoming year, rather than 
sharing broad intentions.

-  Check that the action is achievable: Ensure the commitment is practical and not overly ambitious. It 

should be something they can realistically achieve within a set timeframe.

-  Break it down into small steps: Remind participants that sometimes big insights can lead to overly 

ambitious goals. Encourage them to start small. At Points of You®, we often use the “1-1-1 rule”: One 
thing you’ll do in the next 24 hours, one thing within a week, and one thing within a month. This 
keeps the momentum going without feeling overwhelming.

-  Use the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound): Guide 

participants to refine their action steps so they’re clear and focused.

-  Walk around and provide support: If you notice any participants struggling to pinpoint a concrete 

action, step in and help them refine their idea into something small and achievable.

10. Feedback to the Manager   (15 minutes)

Now that we’ve completed the four stages of the dialogue, we will shift gears and provide feedback to 
the managers. This time, Partner B (Employee) will give feedback to Partner A (Manager) on how they 
facilitated the conversation. This feedback session follows the Points of You® style, the key it to help 
Person to feel more confident in leading these sessions for their employees.
We’ve now moved through the entire structured dialogue process, and it’s time for some feedback. This 
part of the exercise is crucial because it allows managers to hear directly from their ‘employee’ on what 
worked well, what can be polished, and the main takeaway as a manager. The goal is not to criticize but 
to provide constructive feedback that fosters growth.

Activity Instructions:
-  Partner B (Employee):

–  What Worked for Me: Share what the manager did well during the conversation. Focus on specific 

actions or behaviours that made the dialogue effective.

–  Polish Points: Provide what elements could be improved. Again, be specific – share how slight 

adjustments could enhance the conversation.

–  Key Takeaway for the Manager: Highlight one main takeaway you have as a manager from this 

conversation.
-  Partner A (Manager):

–  Listen actively and take notes. This is an opportunity for reflection and growth.
–  Feel free to ask clarifying questions to better understand the feedback.

Feedback is a gift that allows us to see ourselves through the eyes of others. As managers, embracing this 
feedback can help you build stronger, more meaningful connections with your teams.

Trainer Tip:
Encourage Partner B to be specific and constructive. Instead of saying, “You were good,” guide them to 
share details like, “I appreciated how you paused and gave me space to think.”
Remind Partner A to listen without interrupting and to view the feedback as an opportunity for selfimprovement.
If you notice that some participants are struggling with giving constructive feedback, gently intervene and 
offer prompts to guide them.

11. Break  (10-15 minutes)

We’ve made great progress so far, and it’s time to take a short break. Use this time to stretch, grab a 
coffee, and clear your mind. When we come back, we’ll continue with the next phase of our training.

Trainer Tip:
-  Reconnect to the Process:

–  Before participants leave for their break, remind them to carry the insights from the previous 

session with them. You could say:
-  “As you take this break, think about what you’ve learned so far. Let these thoughts simmer, and 

when we come back, we’ll build on them.”

-  Set the Tone for Return:

–  Mention that when participants return, they will be engaging in the next phase, where they will 

use the insights and reflections to further deepen their understanding.

-  Use the Time Wisely:

–  During the break, check in with participants who may seem unsure or hesitant about the process 

so far. It’s a great opportunity for some informal one-on-one conversations to ensure everyone feels 
supported.

12. Tips & Pointers   (10 minutes)

Now that we’ve completed the first round of the dialogue process, let’s take a moment to reflect on what 
we observed. As we switch roles, I want to share some practical tips to help you facilitate the process 
more effectively in the next round. This time, you’ll be leading on your own, so keep these pointers in 
mind as you step into the role of the manager.

Key Tips to Share with Participants

-  Be Present and Listen Fully

–  Focus on creating a space where your partner feels safe to express themselves openly. Practice 

active listening – this means being fully present, without interrupting or jumping in with solutions.
–  Tip: Sometimes, the best insights come from simply allowing silence to happen. Give your partner 

time to think and process before responding.

-  Guide, Don’t Dominate

–  Encourage your partner (employee) to lead the conversation. Use open-ended questions to explore 
their thoughts without pushing them toward a specific outcome. This will empower them to find 
their own insights.

–  Tip: Instead of trying to solve their problems, focus on guiding them toward self-reflection.

-  Use Metaphors to Deepen Understanding

–  Metaphors can unlock deeper insights by connecting abstract ideas with tangible images. If a 

partner is struggling to articulate their thoughts, suggest using a metaphor:
-  For example, ask, “If your goal was a journey, what kind of road are you on right now?”
-  Or, “Imagine your current project as a tree – what stage of growth is it in?”

-  Encourage Specificity

–  When it comes to action steps, encourage your partner to be as specific as possible. Use questions 

like, “How exactly will you implement this?” or “What’s the first small step you can take?”

–  Tip: If they are stuck, revisit the conversation to identify concrete, actionable takeaways.

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

-  Stay Mindful of Time

–  The second round will be led by you, so be conscious of the time for each phase. It’s easy to get 

absorbed, but keeping an eye on the clock ensures you cover all the stages effectively.

–  Tip: Use your phone or a timer to stay on track without being too obvious.

-  Choose Photo Cards Face Down for an Element of Surprise

–  To encourage creativity and spontaneity, consider selecting Photo cards face down. This can help 

bring fresh, unexpected perspectives into the conversation.

–  Tip: Let your intuition guide the selection – sometimes the image you don’t expect to choose can 

provide the deepest insights.

-  Reconnect to the Performance Meeting if It Gets Emotional

–  Sometimes, conversations can veer into personal or emotional territory, especially when 

discussing growth and performance. It’s crucial to acknowledge feelings but also to gently steer the 
conversation back on track:
-  For example, you might say, “I hear that this is really important to you. Let’s explore how it 

connects to your goals for the upcoming year.”

-  Use tools like the Photo or Word cards to re-energize and refocus the dialogue.

-  Adjust If Needed

–  Be flexible and adapt as the conversation unfolds. If your partner gets stuck or if the discussion 
drifts off topic, don’t hesitate to redirect. Use the cards to shift the energy and bring in new 
perspectives.

–  Trainer Tip: Remind participants that the goal of this exercise is not perfection, but practice and 

growth. Encourage them to be curious, to experiment, and to enjoy the process.

Expanded Trainer Tips: Effective Use of Time-Outs

Throughout today’s session, as a trainer, you have the flexibility to call a time-out whenever necessary. 
These pauses are essential to guide participants, correct behaviours, or highlight learning moments 
without overwhelming the group. However, using time-outs effectively requires balancing between 
addressing immediate issues and deciding what can be discussed later during feedback or Q&A sessions.

Guidelines for Trainers on Using Time-Outs
When to Call a Time-Out:
-  The Group Is Off Track: If the conversation has strayed too far from the objective, pause to realign 

everyone with the intended focus of the exercise.

-  A Teachable Moment Arises: If you notice a behavior that can serve as a learning opportunity – such 

as effective use of body language or a missed opportunity to listen – pause to highlight it.

-  Behavior Needs Immediate Correction: For issues like dominating the conversation, not using the 

tools properly, or a lack of engagement, pause to address it directly and guide participants back on 
track.

When to Save It for Later:
-  Minor Observations: If it’s a minor point that doesn’t impact the flow, jot it down and address it during 

the feedback or Q&A sessions.

-  Avoid Overloading Participants: If managers are already focused on the exercise, avoid interrupting 

too frequently. Save less critical feedback for the debrief.

-  Reflection Points: If an issue requires more reflection, wait until the end of the exercise to provide 

comprehensive feedback.

What to Watch Out For (Behavioral Cues)
Include these cues in your time-outs to make managers aware of behaviors they might not be noticing:

-  Phone Usage:

I noticed some participants checking their phones. Remember, staying fully present is crucial in 
creating a meaningful conversation.”

-  Body Language (Crossed Arms or Closed Posture):

Let’s pause here. Notice how your body language impacts the dialogue. An open posture invites 
openness from your partner.

-  Cutting Off or Dominating the Conversation:

Let’s take a moment. Are we giving enough space for the other person to share their thoughts, or are 
we steering the conversation too much?
-  Not Using the Cards or Drifting Off Topic:

I’m seeing some drift from the topic. Let’s refocus on the cards and the question at hand to guide our 
dialogue.

-  Rushing Through the Conversation:

I noticed we’re moving quickly. Let’s slow down to allow time for deeper reflection and responses.

13. Switch Roles & Facilitate the Full Process   (35 minutes)

Now it’s time for the second partner to step into the role of the manager and lead the session. This 
time, the first partner will experience the conversation from the perspective of the employee. Unlike 
the first round, where we paused to reflect on each step, this round will be a continuous, uninterrupted 
experience. The goal is to simulate a complete meeting, allowing you to practice guiding the 
conversation fluidly from start to finish.

-  Step 1: Role Reversal

Partner A (who was the manager) will now take on the role of the employee.
Partner B (who was the employee) will now act as the manager.

-  Step 2: Facilitate the Dialogue Process

The new manager (Partner B) will guide their partner (Partner A) through all four steps of the Points of 
You® Method: 
–  Pause – Create a reflective space to start the conversation.
–  Expand – Use Photo cards to explore new perspectives.
–  Focus – Select a Word card to identify a key insight.
–  Doing – Turn insights into concrete action steps.

-  Participants will have 30 minutes to complete the full process without interruptions.

Trainer Tips
-  Using the Manager’s Booklet: Encourage managers to refer to the booklet throughout the exercise. It 

includes a structured outline and prompts to help guide the conversation effectively.

-  Whiteboard Support: Write a few key questions on the whiteboard for participants to refer to, such as:

–  What details stand out in the photo?
–  How does this image relate to your current challenges or goals?
–  What new insights are emerging from this reflection?

-  Time Management: Remind managers to be mindful of the time to ensure they cover all four stages. A 

timer can be helpful to stay on track.

-  Flexibility & Adaptation: Encourage managers to stay adaptable. If the conversation starts to drift or 
they get stuck, remind them to use the Photo or Word cards to shift perspectives and re-energize the 
dialogue.

-  Time-Out Option: Let participants know that if the conversation becomes unproductive or they feel 

lost, it’s perfectly okay to call a time-out.

14. Feedback to the Manager   (10 minutes)

Now that we’ve completed the second round of the dialogue process, it’s time to shift gears and provide 
feedback to the new managers. This feedback session is crucial because it helps managers understand 
how they are facilitating conversations and where they can improve. Remember, the goal here is to 
foster growth, not to criticize. Let’s focus on providing constructive, specific feedback that can help build 
confidence and refine facilitation skills.

-  Partner A (Employee):

–  What Worked for Me: Share what the manager did well during the conversation. Be specific about 

actions or behaviours that made the dialogue effective and meaningful.

–  Polish Points: Identify areas that could be improved. Again, be specific – suggest how slight 

adjustments could enhance the conversation.

–  Key Takeaway for me as a Manager: Highlight one main takeaway you have for the manager from 
this conversation. This could be a particular strength you noticed or an area to focus on moving 
forward.

[ 202 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 2

Table of Contents  >

-  Partner B (Manager):

–  Listen Actively: Take notes during the feedback. This is your opportunity to learn and grow.
–  Ask Clarifying Questions: If something isn’t clear, feel free to ask for more details to better 

understand the feedback.

–  Embrace the Feedback: View this session as a gift that allows you to see your facilitation through 

someone else’s eyes. This is an opportunity to build stronger skills and connections with your team.

Trainer Tips
-  Encourage Specificity: Guide Partner A to be as specific as possible. Instead of general praise like, 

“You were good,” encourage feedback like, “I appreciated how you paused to give me space to think 
about my response.”

-  Focus on Constructive Feedback: Remind participants that feedback should be constructive and 

focused on growth. This isn’t about perfection but rather about continuous improvement.

-  Support Active Listening: Remind Partner B (Manager) to listen without interrupting. Encourage them 

to see feedback as a valuable tool for self-reflection and growth.

-  Intervene if Needed: If you notice participants struggling to give constructive feedback, gently 

intervene and offer prompts like:
–  Can you share a specific example of what worked well?
–  What’s one thing they could do differently to enhance the dialogue?
–  How did their facilitation style impact your experience as the employee?

15. Q&A Session   (15 minutes)

Now that we’ve gone through the full process and received feedback, let’s take some time for any final 
questions. This is your opportunity to ask anything that’s on your mind. The goal is to ensure you feel 
confident and ready to use the process chart and tools in your own sessions.

-  Open the Floor for Questions:

–  Encourage participants to ask about any part of the process, techniques, or challenges they may 

– 

face when applying these tools with their teams.
If questions are slow to come in, prompt participants with examples like:
-  Is there a specific part of the process you’re unsure about?
-  Are there scenarios where you feel you might struggle to apply this method?
-  Any concerns about using these tools in real-world conversations?

-  Encourage Peer Sharing:

–  Allow managers who have already tried similar techniques to share their experiences or tips with 

the group. This helps create a collaborative learning environment.

Trainer Tip:
-  Ensure that the atmosphere remains open and supportive. Emphasize that there are no ‘wrong’ 

questions – this is a safe space for exploration and clarity.

16. Closure & Talk About the Manager Booklet   (10 minutes)

Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a few final thoughts on how to continue practicing and 
refining these skills.

-  Introducing the Manager Booklet:

–  Highlight the Content:

-  You all have the Manager Booklet with you, which includes everything we covered today. It 

contains structured scripts, prompts, and different layouts you can use to adapt the process to 
your own style.

-  This booklet is designed to be your guide as you start applying these techniques. Whenever 
you’re unsure, refer back to it – it’s a resource to support you in real-world conversations.

–  Encouragement to Practice:

-  Remember, confidence comes with practice. The more you use these tools, the more natural it 

will feel. Don’t hesitate to try out different layouts and approaches.

-  Learning happens through doing. Take the techniques we’ve covered today, experiment with 

them, and see what works best for you and your team.

And now, to close our session, let’s take a moment to reflect. I invite each of you to share just one word 
that captures what you’re taking away from today’s training. It could be a new insight, a feeling, or even 
something you’re excited to explore further.

-  One-Word Reflection:

–  Setting the Tone: Now, let’s take a moment to reflect on today’s session. I’d like each of you to 

share just one word that captures what you’re taking away from today’s training.

–  How It Works:

-  Invite who is ready to share their one word, continue till everyone has shared.
-  This final reflection helps consolidate the learning experience and ends the session on a 

positive, thoughtful note.

Thank you all for your enthusiasm and active participation today. I hope you leave feeling inspired and 
equipped to bring these tools into your work. Keep experimenting, keep learning, and remember – 
you’ve got all the resources you need to succeed. Let’s go out there and make our conversations more 
meaningful. Well done, everyone!"

Adjustments & Flexibility

In this module, we’ve focused on guiding you through the feedback and assessment process using the 
End-of-Year Conversation template. This approach is ideal for reflecting on past achievements, setting 
new goals, and aligning expectations for the upcoming year. However, the Manager Booklet offers a 
range of other templates that can be adapted to fit different conversations throughout the year.
This session plan is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to extend or shorten the training based 
on your team’s specific needs. The same structure we’ve practiced today can be applied using different 
templates to address various conversations, whether it’s goal-setting, mid-year check-ins, or performance 
reviews.

Why This Matters:
-  It’s crucial to teach managers something that is relevant right now, not just a conversation they might 
have in six months. By selecting the template that aligns with the current needs of your organization, 
you ensure the training is timely and impactful.

-  Managers can immediately apply these skills with their teams, enhancing engagement and 

effectiveness in their everyday interactions.

Expanding the Application: Each of these templates can also be adapted into standalone training sessions 
that you can facilitate within your organization. This means that, as a trainer, you can use the same 
structure we’ve covered but switch out the templates to fit the needs of your managers at any given time 
of year. By doing so, you create ongoing opportunities for growth, helping managers develop specific 
skills tailored to their current challenges.

Below are examples of how you can adapt the template to different conversations:

Trainer Tip:
-  Use the templates to adapt the training session to your organization’s current needs. For example, if 

it’s the beginning of the year, leverage the Beginning-of-Year Conversation template to help managers 
set clear expectations and goals.

-  Encourage managers to replicate this structure with their own teams. Each of these templates can 

serve as a blueprint for conversations that drive meaningful engagement and growth throughout the 
year.

By incorporating these different templates, you ensure that managers are not only equipped to lead 
impactful conversations but also empowered to teach and guide their teams, fostering a culture of 
continuous development.

Train the Trainer Module 3: Coaching Conversations

Introduction

This module is part of the Train the Trainer (TTT) program and focuses on equipping managers with 
the tools and skills needed to conduct impactful coaching conversations. Unlike Module 2, which 
emphasized structured feedback and assessment processes, Module 3 highlights freestyle coaching 
conversations – spontaneous, meaningful exchanges that empower employees to reflect, grow, and take 
action.

Coaching conversations are not full coaching sessions but practical, outcome-driven interactions 
designed to build trust and foster impactful results. They are essential for new managers learning to listen, 
guide, and connect with their team members on a deeper level.

The techniques in this module will help managers:

-  Be present and listen: Cultivate the skill of active listening and understanding employees.
-  Focus on small, manageable issues: Avoid overwhelming conversations and instead address topics 

with achievable outcomes.

-  Guide conversations toward action: Conclude every conversation with a clear, actionable next step.

Session Objectives

-  Teach Managers advanced listening and questioning skills to build trust and drive impactful 

conversations.

-  Equip Managers to confidently use the SpeakUp Toolkit to lead coaching conversations with their 

employees during one-on-one meetings.

Training Overview

-  Duration: 3.5 hours
-  Format: Face-to-face using SpeakUp tools or online with SpeakUp Digital.
-  Participants: Groups of 8-15 People Managers, HR, OD, or LD Specialists.

Materials Needed:

-  SpeakUp Toolkit (photo cards, question cards, word cards).
-  Manager Booklet.
-  A whiteboard or flipchart for trainer notes.
-  Speaker and Pause Music. (Apple Music | Spotify)

By-the-Book Guide for Trainers

The following section provides a clear, step-by-step guide for trainers to confidently lead this session. 
Each activity is accompanied by detailed instructions, scripts, and practical tips to help you facilitate the 
process effectively. These guidelines are crafted to ensure a smooth, engaging, and adaptable learning 
experience, empowering managers to confidently integrate the Speak Up tool into their coaching 
conversations.

While this guide focuses on a standard 3.5-hour session, you can adapt the format, having more time 
gives you time to practice more.

1. Welcome & Why Coaching Matters   (10 min)

Welcome, everyone! It’s great to have you back for the next module of the Speak Up Train the Trainer 
series. Building on the skills we developed previously, today we’re expanding into the world of coaching 
conversations.
Unlike structured feedback sessions, coaching conversations are shorter, more spontaneous interactions 
designed to guide employees toward growth and actionable solutions. These conversations are less about 
solving problems for your team and more about creating a space for them to reflect, uncover insights, and 
take meaningful steps forward.

Before we dive into the framework, let’s start with some reflection:
-  What is coaching?
-  How do you know when you’re having a coaching conversation instead of a conventional one?

Let’s hear your thoughts.

Summarize answers into key principles:
-  Coaching is about asking questions rather than giving answers.
-  It’s focused on reflection, insight, and action.
-  Coaching conversations empower employees to take ownership of their growth.
-  Define Coaching for the Group:

Coaching is a process of guiding individuals to uncover their own insights, solutions, and next steps 
through reflective dialogue and open-ended questions. It’s a shift from directive management to 
collaborative leadership.

Objectives
In this session, we have two key objectives:
1.  To teach Managers advanced listening and questioning skills to build trust and drive impactful 

conversations.

2.  To equip Managers to confidently use the SpeakUp Toolkit to lead coaching conversations during one-

on-one meetings.

By the end of this session, you’ll have the tools and confidence to conduct coaching conversations that 
are engaging, effective, and action-oriented.

Why Coaching Conversations Matter
Traditionally, managers have been expected to deliver results through instruction, evaluation, and control. 
This top-down approach often misses opportunities for growth and engagement.
Today, managers are expected to do more than just manage tasks – they’re expected to build trust, foster 
relationships, and empower their teams. Coaching conversations are a powerful way to make this shift. 
They allow managers to approach challenges with curiosity and empathy, turning everyday interactions 
into moments of growth and connection.

Research shows the importance of coaching conversations for managers and teams:
1.  Improves Performance: Coaching helps employees gain clarity and take ownership of their goals. 
According to the International Coach Federation (ICF), 86% of companies report improved work 
performance due to coaching. (Institute of Coaching)

2.  Increases Engagement: Employees who feel heard are more motivated and committed to their work. 

Research from Gallup shows that managers account for 70% of the variance in team engagement, and 
coaching helps foster trust and motivation. (The leadership Variance)

3.  Encourages Growth: Coaching builds self-awareness, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. Harvard 
Business Review notes that employees coached to develop these qualities are more likely to adapt 
and thrive in dynamic work environments. (Harvard Business Review)

4.  Boosts Retention: Coached employees are more likely to feel supported and stay with the 

organization. A study by the Corporate Leadership Council found that managers who coach effectively 
can improve employee retention rates by up to 40%. (British Council)

When managers use coaching conversations as part of their leadership style, they create trust, 
connection, and an environment where team members feel valued and supported.
Reflective Engagement: The Knowledge-Practice Gap

Many of you may have attended coaching or leadership training sessions before, so let me ask:
-  How many of you have attended coaching training or coaching-oriented leadership sessions?
-  Great. Now, how many of you are applying those coaching skills in your daily work? Would you say:

–  100%?
–  50%?
–  Less than 50%? 

[ 215 ]

Let’s talk about why this happens. What makes it challenging to consistently use these skills?
-  Facilitate Discussion:

Gather responses, which may include time constraints, habit, or balancing coaching with other 
priorities.

-  Bridge to Speak Up:

These challenges are common and highlight why tools like Speak Up are so valuable. Speak Up 
simplifies coaching conversations, offering a practical framework that’s easy to apply. It helps 
managers stay present and guide employees effectively, creating healthier and more productive 
relationships.

Today, we’ll explore how this tool makes coaching approachable and impactful – even in the busiest of 
work environments.”

Leaving with a Reflective Question
(Use this part if your participants have not attended coaching-oriented workshops before.)
As we move into today’s session, I’d like you to reflect on this:
How can coaching skills improve and influence your leadership?

Take a moment to consider this as we dive into the coaching framework that will guide our work today.

Trainer Tip:
-  Emphasize the Connection Between Modules:

– 

– 

If participants have completed Module 2, highlight how structured feedback conversations provide 
the foundation, while coaching conversations add flexibility for real-time growth opportunities.
If participants are coming from Module 1, connect to the idea of shifting perspectives and using 
visual tools to create meaningful conversations.

-  Reinforce Coaching as a Mindset Shift:

Coaching isn’t just a skill set; it’s a mindset shift toward fostering trust, connection, and growth in 
every interaction. Encourage participants to see coaching conversations as an opportunity to build 
deeper relationships while driving action and accountability.

2. Flexible Coaching Framework   (15 min)

Before we dive into practice, let’s revisit the core method we’re using today:  
Pause → Expand → Focus → Doing. This framework is a guide to help you lead meaningful coaching 
conversations, taking your employee through a process that’s thoughtful, empowering, and actionable.
By following these steps, you’ll create a space where employees feel truly heard. This isn’t about solving 
everything at once or rushing to action – it’s about guiding a conversation where employees can reflect, 
explore, and take ownership of their next steps.

The Four Steps of the Points of You® Method:

Pause:
-  What It Is: A moment to shift energy, become present and set the tone for the conversation.
-  Why It Matters: This step creates presence and focus, helping both you and your employee 

leave distractions behind and start with clarity.

-  Example: Taking a few deep breaths, listening to music, writing, self-journaling. 

Expand:
-  What It Is: A space to explore new perspectives, to see things from different angles, to 

explore thoughts and emotions..

-  Why It Matters: This step is about looking up, to break the pattern of thought, to look at 

different perspectives before rushing to conclusions.

-  Example: Use the Photo cards and open-ended questions to explore your issue.

Focus:
-  What It Is: Narrowing down insights into a clear priority or key takeaway.
-  Why It Matters: This step identifies the main point of the conversation, helping both you and 

your employee concentrate on what’s most important.

-  Example: Summarizing: what is the main insight you take, what sounds as the most 

important right now, using a word card to frame the conversation.

  Doing:

-  What It Is: Turning insights into actionable steps.
-  Why It Matters: This step ensures the conversation ends with a concrete plan, giving your 

employee something to work on or reflect on. To make the conversation change something.
-  Example: Co-creating an action item: “What’s one thing you can commit to doing this week 

to address this?”

Why the Method Works:
It’s tempting as managers to jump straight to action – we want to solve the problem quickly and move 
forward. But by following these steps, you ensure that you’re addressing the real issue, not just the 
symptoms.

At the same time, this process helps employees who feel stuck. By pausing and expanding first, 
you create the space they need to gain clarity and momentum. Most importantly, this method helps 
employees feel valued and heard, whether the conversation lasts five minutes or half an hour.

[ 217 ]

Table of Contents  >

Trainer Tips:
-  Remind Participants of the Speak Up Tools:

If you’re unsure where to start or feel stuck in the moment, remember what’s in the Speak Up toolkit. 
The photo cards, question cards, word cards, stickers and the gameboard are all designed to guide 
and inspire these conversations.

-  Reconnect to Points of You®:

Don’t forget the essence of Points of You® – the idea that every situation has multiple perspectives. 
When you use the tools, you’re helping employees step back, shift their perspective, and uncover new 
insights. That’s the magic of this approach.

-  Empower Managers to Adapt:

This method is flexible. Use the steps that resonate most in the moment and adjust the length of the 
conversation based on the context. The goal is to help employees feel heard and leave with a clear 
next step.

Experience Pause Points of You® Style
Now that we’ve explored the framework, let’s take a moment to ground ourselves before moving into the 
tools. As we’ve discussed, Pause is about creating space to connect and shift energy.
This time, we’ll experience a Pause Points of You® style. It’s an opportunity to connect with yourself – 
your body, thoughts, and feelings – and notice where you are in this moment.

Here’s what we’ll do:
-  We’ll listen to a short piece of music (Pause playlist: Apple Music | Spotify) while everyone is sitting 

quietly.

-  If you feel comfortable, I invite you to close your eyes and simply be present.
-  Use this time to connect to yourself, your emotions, and your thoughts. There’s no right or wrong way 

to experience this – it’s about being in the moment.

-  After the pause count to 10 before continuing.

3. Core Coaching Tools   (65 min)

Before we dive into practice, let’s take a moment to understand the tools we’ll be working with. These 
tools – paraphrasing, rephrasing, asking powerful questions, and the PR framework – are the building 
blocks of coaching.
What makes them powerful is their versatility. These aren’t just techniques for formal coaching 
conversations – they’re skills you can use in everyday interactions with your team. Whether it’s a quick 
check-in, addressing a challenge, or guiding someone through a decision, these tools help you connect, 
listen, and guide more effectively.
Coaching is about creating a space where your employee feels heard and empowered to uncover their 
own solutions. These tools enable you to do just that.

Introducing the Tools

1.  Paraphrasing:

-  Paraphrasing is about reflecting back what the other person said. We try to capture the main words 
that we hear. It shows that you’re truly listening and helps clarify what’s being communicated. It’s 
also a way to ensure mutual understanding.

-  Example:

–  Coachee: “I’m feeling overwhelmed by deadlines.”
–  Paraphrase: “It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure to meet your deadlines.”

2.  Rephrasing:

-  Rephrasing takes paraphrasing a step further. It’s about listening deeply to the tone, body language, 
and context of what’s being said and reflecting back what you hear. Think of it as 'hearing the 
music of the conversation.' Your goal is to surface underlying emotions or subtext gently, without 
projecting your own assumptions.

-  Example:

–  Coachee: “I’m worried about making mistakes.”
–  Rephrase: “I am also hearing frustration from your voice, is it true? If yes, why? (Retell the story 

told by the employee with your own words.)

3.  Asking Powerful Questions:

-  Questions are at the heart of coaching. A good question invites the coachee to reflect, explore, 

and uncover their own insights. The best questions are open-ended and focused on growth – not 
solving the problem for them, but helping them find their own answers. The Speak Up toolkit 
equips you with 30 powerful questions you can always use

-  Example Questions:

–  “What feels most important about this issue?”
–  “What’s holding you back from moving forward?”
–  “If success in this situation were guaranteed, what would it look like?”

4.  PR Framework:

-  The PR framework is a simple yet effective way to approach tough conversations. It’s to prepare 
the coachee for a message that we want to say. It’s to create a space for the message we want to 
deliver. It helps you frame your message clearly and considers how the other person might feel, so 
your message lands with empathy.

-  Read more about PR here
-  Example:

–  Our relationship is important for me, so this is why I want to share it with you .
–  What am I about to share is just my perspective, you can take from it what resonates with you

[ 219 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 3

Table of Contents  >

Trainer Tip:
-  Emphasize that these tools are not just techniques – they’re habits that build trust and connection. 

They’re skills that can transform everyday conversations into opportunities for growth and 
understanding.

-  Ask One Question at a Time: Avoid asking multiple questions at once, as this can confuse the coachee 
or dilute the focus of the conversation. Give them space to think and respond to each question before 
moving on.

-  Prepare Employees for the Approach (PR):

–  Encourage managers to explain to their employees that this is a shift toward a more reflective and 

– 

– 

collaborative conversation style.
 Framing it positively ensures employees feel comfortable and engaged, rather than surprised or 
resistant.
 Example for Managers to Use: We’re going to try a different way of working together, one that 
focuses more on reflection and exploring ideas. I’d love to hear your thoughts and see how this 
approach works for us both. 

Partner Exercise
-  You’ll work in pairs to practice the flow of a coaching conversation using the tools we’ve discussed. 

This isn’t about solving problems but being present and creating space for your partner to explore. We 
invite you to find a partner and choose who is going to be A and B. A you will be the coachee and B 
you will be the coach. 

-  Structure   (25 min per person):

5 min – Sharing
–  The coachee (Person A) shares anything they want – a challenge, a reflection, or a thought they’re 

working through or dealing with.

–  The coachee (Person A)  selects a photo card to deepen or illustrate their sharing.

2 min – Paraphrasing
–  The coach (Person B) reflects back what they heard, staying closely aligned with the coachee’s 

words.

1 min – Question Card Selection
–  The coach (Person B) selects 1-3 Question cards to guide the conversation.
–  During this time, the coachee (Person A) reflects silently and writes down any key points they feel 

the coach heard.

5 min – Asking Questions
–  The coach (Person B) uses the selected Question cards to guide exploration, focusing on the 

coachee’s issue and the coachee (Person A) answers. There may be enough time to ask 1 question, 
maybe 2.

5 min – Rephrasing and Summarizing
–  The coach (Person B) reflects back key themes, tone, and subtext they observed during the 

conversation.

5 min – Feedback
–  The coachee (Person A) provides feedback to the coach:

-  What worked well?
-  What could be polished?
-  Their main takeaway from the Coach and how they worked. 

[ 220 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTrain the Trainer  |  Module 3

Table of Contents  >

Trainer Tip:
-  In this exercise, we’re intentionally pushing for the full 15 minutes. This isn’t about conducting a full 
coaching session – it’s about practicing how to start a meaningful conversation and take that first step.

-  Focus on Presence: Remind participants that the silence and photo card selection are intentional 

pauses to shift energy and center the conversation.

-  Avoid Overcomplicating: Encourage coaches to focus on paraphrasing and asking meaningful 

questions rather than trying to do everything at once.

-  The Map and the Territory Concept:

–  Remember, each person has their own “map” of every situation, shaped by their unique 

experiences and perspectives. As a Coach or Manager, it’s essential to respect and work within the 
coachee’s “territory.”

–  Be mindful not to impose your own narrative or add words that haven’t been said. Instead, focus 
on taking the coachee’s words and narrative as they are, reflecting them back with accuracy and 
care.

-  Trust Your Intuition: If a question you chose doesn’t feel relevant to what the coachee brought to the 
conversation, trust your intuition. Instead, ask an open-ended question that resonates with the flow 
of the dialogue. Coaching conversations are dynamic, and your ability to adapt makes them more 
meaningful.

Section 4: Applying the Framework in Pairs   (75 min)

“Now that you’ve practiced the individual tools, it’s time to bring everything together. In this section, 
we’ll work with the full coaching framework – Pause → Expand → Focus & Action – to simulate a 
complete coaching conversation.
I’ll begin by demonstrating the framework with a volunteer so you can observe how the flow works. 
After the demo, you’ll practice in pairs, taking turns as Coach and Coachee, to experience the framework 
firsthand.”

[ 221 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTable of Contents  >

Trainer Demo   (15 min)
For this demo, I’ll act as the Coach, and I will invite one of you to be the coachee. I’ll guide the 
conversation using the full coaching framework – Pause → Expand → Focus & Action – to show you how 
these steps work in a real-time coaching conversation.
This is meant to feel natural and spontaneous, so don’t worry about perfection. The goal is to create 
momentum and focus on small, actionable steps.

Before we begin the demo, I’d like to invite one of you to volunteer to act as the Coachee for this 
exercise. I understand it might feel a bit intimidating to come up here in front of your peers, but let me 
share why this is a unique opportunity:
-  Experience the Framework Firsthand: By stepping into the role of the Coachee, you’ll see how the 
coaching framework works from the inside, giving you valuable insights into how it feels for your 
team members during a real conversation.

-  Focus on a Small Challenge: This is not about solving a big, complex problem. We’ll focus on a small, 

manageable challenge or reflection, so it stays light and comfortable.

-  Safe and Supportive Environment: Remember, this is a learning space. Everyone here is in the same 

process, practicing and growing together. 

Taking part in this demo is a way to explore, try something new, and experience coaching in a guided 
and supportive way. If this resonates with you, I’d love for you to join me.

Demo Steps   (15 min):
-  Pause

–  Begin by helping the Coachee settle into the conversation.
–  Ask about a communication challenge they may be facing and give them space to share.
–  Allow time for the Coachee to “arrive” mentally in the conversation, creating presence and focus.

-  Expand

–  While listening to the issue, invite the Coachee to choose a Photo card that resonates with them 

and explore its connection to their challenge.

–  Use a Question card to expand the conversation and help uncover new perspectives.
–  Focus on listening deeply and rephrasing their insights to surface deeper meaning.

Invite the Coachee to choose a Word card that summarizes what they shared.

-  Focus
– 
–  Ask them to reflect on their main takeaway and rephrase it back to them to check alignment.
–  Confirm with the Coachee how it feels and ensure clarity.

-  Action

–  Guide the Coachee toward identifying a small, clear next step based on the conversation.
–  Support them in articulating this step as something achievable and actionable. 

Debrief the Demo   (5 min):
-  “What did you notice about the flow of the conversation?”
-  “How did the tools (cards, stickers, board) support the conversation?”
-  “What felt spontaneous or natural about this process?” 

Trainer Tips:
-  Focus on Manageable Challenges:

If the Coachee presents a big challenge, focus on finding one small, actionable part to address. This 
keeps the conversation productive and manageable.
Additionally, guide the Coachee to explore what’s within their control to change. Ask reflective 
questions like, How does this challenge make you feel? or What part of this is up to you to act on?
Even if the situation itself cannot change, the conversation can help the Coachee shift their 
perspective, empowering them to approach it with clarity and confidence.

[ 222 ]

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTable of Contents  >

-  Integrate Tools Seamlessly:

Make use of the tools you practiced earlier – photo cards, question cards, word cards, and even the 
board or stickers. These elements keep the conversation engaging and visually rich.

-  Highlight Spontaneity:

Remind participants that while we learned tools earlier in a structured way, this exercise is about 
applying them naturally. Coaching conversations don’t have to be perfect – they just need to create 
movement and clarity.

-  Create Momentum:

The focus is on progress, not resolution. Help the Coachee take one clear step forward, even if it’s 
small.

Pair Practice   (55 min) 

1.  Explain the Pair Practice Setup   (5 min):

-  “You’ll work in pairs, taking turns as Coach and Coachee. The Coach will lead a 15-minute 

coaching conversation using the full framework, and then you’ll switch roles.” 

2.  Structure for Each Round   (20 min per person):

-  15 min Coaching Conversation:

–  Pause: Begin with presence and establish focus.
–  Expand: Explore the topic through open-ended questions.
–  Focus: Summarize key insights and clarify priorities.
–  Action: End with a clear, actionable next step.

-  5 min Feedback:

–  The Coachee shares feedback with the Coach:

-  What worked well?
-  Where could the Coach improve?

3.  Switch Roles:

–  After the first 20-minute round, participants 
switch roles and repeat the process (55 
minutes total for both rounds, including 
transitions).

Trainer Tips:
-  Reinforce Presence:

Encourage the Coach to spend enough time 
in Pause and Expand before moving to Focus 
and Action. Rushing can lead to surface-level 
solutions.”

-  Support the Coachee’s Role:

As the Coachee, share a manageable challenge 
or topic – it doesn’t need to be big or 
complicated. This keeps the conversation realistic 
and actionable, but works on a real issue.

-  Facilitate as Needed:

During practice, move around the room to 
observe. If you notice a pair struggling or getting 
stuck, gently intervene with suggestions or 
prompts.”

Chapter 6 – Official Training TemplatesTable of Contents  >

Section 5: Bringing It Back to Work   (15 min)

Now that you’ve practiced the coaching framework and tools, let’s take some time to reflect on the 
experience, ask any questions, and think about how these skills can fit into your leadership.
Coaching conversations are not about fixing everything in one go. Sometimes the most valuable action 
item is simply to schedule a follow-up conversation. This shows your employees that you’re committed to 
their growth and keeps the momentum going.

-  Open the Space for Questions and Reflections:

– 

Invite participants to share their thoughts, ask questions, or reflect on their experience with the 
exercises.

–  Use prompts to guide the discussion:

-  What worked well for you during the coaching exercises?
-  What felt challenging or unfamiliar?
-  What’s one insight you gained about coaching conversations?

–  Acknowledge participant contributions and use their input to deepen the discussion.

-  Explore Practical Applications:

Shift the conversation to where and how participants can integrate coaching conversations into their 
leadership. Use the following areas to guide exploration:

–  One-on-One Check-Ins:

-  How can coaching tools help guide your regular check-ins?

–  Handling Challenges:

-  How could these tools support a team member dealing with a problem or conflict?

–  Quick Conversations:

-  What are some ways to use this framework in short, informal interactions?

–  Follow-Up:

-  When a challenge is too big to address in one conversation, how might scheduling a follow-up 

keep the momentum going?

-  Encourage Peer Sharing:

–  Prompt participants to share how they might use coaching conversations in their specific contexts.

Coaching conversations don’t have to be formal or lengthy – they’re flexible tools that can be adapted 
to your leadership style. Whether it’s a five-minute check-in or a deeper discussion, the goal is to create 
clarity and action, and sometimes that action is simply scheduling a follow-up.

Trainer Tip:
-  Stay Focused:
Encourage participants to think practically about where coaching fits into their current workflow and 
leadership style.
-  Acknowledge Challenges:
If participants bring up concerns like time constraints or team resistance, share that coaching 
conversations can be short, focused, and often lead to stronger team engagement over time.

Section 6: Closure & Reflection   (10 min)

As we wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to reflect on what we’ve covered and how you 
can bring these tools into your leadership. Today, you’ve explored the coaching framework, practiced 
tools like paraphrasing, rephrasing, and powerful questions, and discovered how to guide coaching 
conversations toward actionable next steps.
Remember, you also have the Manager Booklet as a resource. It contains all the tools and methods we’ve 
worked on today, along with guidance on how to adapt them to different situations. Be sure to revisit it as 
you integrate these practices into your day-to-day conversations.

-  Recap Key Tools and Learnings   (2-3 min)

–  Today, we explored the tools and framework for effective coaching conversations:

-  Pause → Expand → Focus → Action to guide conversations.
-  Tools like paraphrasing, rephrasing, and asking powerful questions to deepen reflection and 

connection.

-  Using Speak Up elements – photo cards, question cards, word cards, and more – to make 

conversations engaging and meaningful.

-  These tools are outlined in your Manager Booklet, along with additional tips and templates to 
support your practice. Keep it handy as you begin applying these skills in your professional 
work.

-  Capture Insight and Action Item   (4-5 min)

Take a moment to reflect: What’s one key insight you gained from today? Now think about how you 
can apply this insight in your professional work. What’s one small action item you can commit to 
taking that will help you start integrating what you’ve learned?

-  End with One Word   (2 min)

Finally, let’s go around and share one word that captures what you’re taking away from today’s 
session. It could reflect how you’re feeling, something you’ve learned, or your intention moving 
forward.

Trainer Tip:
-  Keep it Practical:

Encourage participants to choose an action item that feels realistic and achievable. Remind them that 
coaching is a process, and small steps can lead to big changes over time.”

-  Celebrate Progress:

Acknowledge the effort participants have put into today’s session and the importance of their 
commitment to growth.

-  Encouraging Managers to Try the Tools:

As you begin using these tools with your employees, remember to introduce the process thoughtfully. 
Let them know you’re trying a different approach to create space for reflection and growth.

Final Words from the Trainer
Thank you all for your engagement and openness today. Coaching is a skill that develops over time, and 
every conversation you have strengthens your ability to connect, guide, and empower your team. I look 
forward to hearing how these tools make an impact in your leadership journey!

Time Adjustments

If You Have Less Time
If time is limited, the session can be streamlined while still maintaining its impact:
-  Partner Exercise (Core Coaching Tools):

– 

Instead of two rounds, complete only one round:
-  A is the Coachee and B is the Coach for the entire exercise.

-  Coaching Framework in Pairs (Full Coaching Conversation):

– 

In this activity, switch roles:
-  A becomes the Coach for B, completing a 15-minute coaching conversation.

–  This ensures that both participants experience the role of Coach and Coachee across the two 

activities.

By simplifying the exercises to one round each, you save time while still giving participants a meaningful 
opportunity to practice both roles.

If You Have More Time
If additional time is available, consider the following adjustments to deepen learning and reflection:
-  Extended Debriefing:

Spend more time debriefing each activity. Encourage participants to share insights, discuss challenges, 
and explore how the tools felt in practice.

-  Q&A Sessions:

Create more space for participants to ask questions and reflect on their learning. Use this time to 
explore challenges they foresee in applying the tools and brainstorm strategies as a group.

-  Longer Practice Rounds:

Extend the duration of each coaching conversation. Allow Coaches to spend more time in the Expand 
phase to explore perspectives more thoroughly or dive deeper into Focus and Action to refine next 
steps.

Marketing – The Points of You® Engagement Method

Introduction

The Points of You® Engagement Method is designed to help us find the right clients, build meaningful 
relationships, and close deals that create real impact. Rather than relying on traditional sales tactics, our 
approach focuses on attracting the right people, engaging them through experience, and fostering longterm partnerships.

This method follows a structured three-step process:

1.
Reach Out

2.
Marketing 
Meeting

3.
Follow-Up

Identifying the right 
audience, creating 
curiosity, and opening 
doors.

Offering a hands-on 
experience that deepens 
the connection and builds 
trust.

Sustaining engagement, 
addressing concerns, and 
guiding the client toward 
a decision.

The goal is to attract, connect, and convert – not through pressure, but through value. By ensuring 
that clients experience the essence of Points of You® firsthand, we position ourselves not just as service 
providers but as trusted partners in their growth and development.

In the next sections, we will explore each step in depth – how to find the right clients, engage them 
authentically, and build sustainable, long-term relationships.

[ 230 ]

Chapter 8 – Marketing 
Table of Contents  >

Reach Out

Introduction

The Reaching Out phase is all about finding the right clients, creating curiosity, and opening doors for 
meaningful conversations. It is not about selling immediately but about initiating connections with HR 
professionals, L&D managers, and organizational decision-makers in a way that is relevant, engaging, 
and valuable to them.

Our goal in this stage is to:
-  Identify the right audience – 

Be clear on who to reach out to and why they would be interested.

-  Use the right marketing channels – 

LinkedIn, conferences, email, referrals, and campaigns.

-  Craft a strong marketing message – 

One that is precise, engaging, and leads to a meeting.

-  Track and organize outreach efforts – 

Maintain a structured database of contacts and interactions.

This section will guide you through the key steps to make your outreach process effective and structured.

Step 1: Defining Your Target Audience

Before reaching out, you need to be crystal clear on who you are targeting and why. Ask yourself:
-  Who is my ideal audience?

(HR Directors, L&D Managers, Talent Development Leaders, etc.)

-  Which organizations am I targeting?

(Multinational companies, startups, NGOs, family businesses, etc.)

-  Why am I reaching out to this person/organization?
-  What is their need?

(Employee engagement, leadership development, innovative training tools, etc.)

-  What solutions are they already looking for?
Being specific allows us to craft messages that truly resonate with their needs and increases our chances 
of setting up a meeting.

Write down your target audience and their needs below:

Target Group:

Their Needs:

[ 231 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Step 2: Finding and Reaching Your Audience

Once you know who you want to reach, the next step is how to connect with them.

-  LinkedIn & Professional Networks

Research HR & L&D professionals, send strategic messages, engage with their content.

-  Conferences & Industry Events

Attend relevant HR summits and networking events to meet potential clients.

-  Email & Direct Messaging

Send personalized, concise outreach messages that highlight the value of a conversation.

-  Referrals & Recommendations

Leverage existing relationships to get introduced to key decision-makers.

-  Online & Offline Campaigns

Use targeted social media ads, webinars, or content marketing to attract interest.

Different organizations respond to different channels, so test multiple approaches to see what works best.

Plan your marketing channels:

New Channels I want to try:

[ 232 ]

Chapter 8 – Marketing 
Table of Contents  >

Step 3: Crafting the Perfect Outreach Message

Your marketing message should not be a sales pitch – it should:
-  Be short, engaging, and precise.
-  Not attempt to sell over a message – the objective is to schedule a meeting.
-  Create curiosity and interest to explore a potential collaboration.

Best Practices for Outreach Messages:

-  Make it personal & relevant

Show that you understand their work and needs.

-  Keep it short & clear

No long paragraphs – just enough to intrigue them.

-  Make the meeting sound valuable

The session itself should be seen as a gift, not a sales call.

-  Position yourself as a coach, not a salesperson

This shifts the focus to insights and value rather than a product pitch.

My Outreach Message: 

Tip: Framing the Meeting as a Valuable Experience

Most decision-makers won’t book a meeting just for a sales pitch. Instead, position the meeting as a 
valuable experience where they can learn something, gain insight, or explore new tools.

-  Instead of: “Let’s schedule a call so I can tell you about Points of You®”
-  Say: “I’d love to invite you for a short session where I’ll share an interactive experience – something 

you can use immediately with your teams.”

By making the meeting experiential, we increase engagement and interest while setting the foundation 
for a long-term relationship.

Step 4: Managing Follow-Ups & Next Steps

If they don’t respond immediately, it doesn’t mean they’re not interested. HR and L&D managers are busy 
professionals, and follow-ups are a natural part of the process.

Best follow-up strategy:
1.  First message – 
Initial outreach.

2.  Follow-up #1 (3-5 days later) – 

“Just checking in to see if this could be relevant for you. Happy to find a time that works.”

3.  Follow-up #2 (7-10 days later) – 

“I know schedules get busy! Let me know if you'd be open to a short chat this month.”

4.  Final follow-up (after 2 weeks) – 

“Totally understand if now isn’t the right time. Would you be open to staying in touch for future 
opportunities?”

Keep it light, professional, and respectful – we want to build relationships, not pressure anyone.

Step 5: Building & Managing Your Contact Database

To track your outreach efforts effectively, it's important to maintain a structured database of contacts and 
conversations.

What to Track in Your Outreach Database?

A simple Excel or CRM system can help organize your efforts. Below are essential fields to include:

Field Name

Name

Organization

Position

Purpose

The contact’s full name

The company they work for

Their job title (HR Director, L&D Manager, etc.)

Contact Details

Email, LinkedIn, phone number

Outreach Channel

How you contacted them (LinkedIn, email, conference, etc.)

Date of First Contact

When you first reached out

Response Received?

Yes/No

Follow-Up Needed?

Schedule follow-up date

Meeting Scheduled?

Yes/No, date set

Notes

Any key details from conversations

[ 235 ]

Start building your outreach database. Write down 3-5 potential contacts to reach out to:

My Potential Contacts: 

Key Takeaways

-  Reaching out is about connection, not selling.
-  Define your target audience clearly before engaging.
-  Use the right channels – LinkedIn, events, referrals, and campaigns.
-  Keep messages short, personal, and engaging.
-  Position the meeting as an experience, not a pitch.
-  Follow up strategically – persistence is key, but always with professionalism.

This phase sets the foundation for everything that follows. When done right, it leads to high-quality 
meetings, stronger relationships, and long-term opportunities.

Marketing Meeting

Introduction

The Marketing Meeting is a crucial step in the Points of You® Engagement Method. It is designed to share 
an experience, create a meaningful relationship, and spark the interest of the organization or client. This 
meeting is more than just a presentation – it’s about building a connection and allowing potential clients 
to experience our unique approach firsthand.
Below is a structure and guidance on conducting a Marketing Meeting, made up of 5 crucial stages. 
Whether it’s conducted online or in person, the structure ensures that the experience is engaging, 
professional, and aligned with the Points of You® approach.

Before the Meeting

-  Technical & Professional Preparation:

If online, ensure you are already connected through Zoom.

– 
–  Check your video frame, lighting, and background (use a virtual background if needed).
–  Log in to Speak Up Digital with the relevant process open.
–  Have the tools (Speak Up/ ClicKits ready at hand).
–  Research the client or company via LinkedIn/Google to identify key talking points. 

-  Content & Context Preparation:

–  Review the organization’s industry, challenges, and any relevant information.
–  Underline key points that might be interesting for the conversation.
–  During the meeting, observe the setting – what does their office environment tell you about their 

values and priorities?

A breakdown of the key phases of the marketing meeting:

[ 237 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Stage 1: Bonding

Goal: Establish an authentic connection and create the feeling of a long-term journey together.
At this stage, focus on reading the person in front of you and working with what they bring to the 
conversation:

-  Energy Level:

Are they enthusiastic, reserved, formal, or casual? Match their tone accordingly.

-  Content & Expression

Listen not only to what they say but how they say it – observe their tone, intonation, and emotional or 
logical framing.

-  Visual & Environmental Cues:

If on Zoom: How do they position themselves? What’s in the background?
If in person: What does their office or meeting room say about them? Notice personal items like a 
family photo, a book, or an award – these can be conversation starters.

– 
– 

– 

Example: If you notice a family photo behind them, you might say: “I see a beautiful photo behind you – 
family is important to you?” This helps establish a personal, but not intrusive, connection.

[ 238 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

The Power of Authenticity

To create a real connection, be willing to share your own authenticity – even small, personal moments 
can make a difference.

Example:
“Wow, today has been non-stop for me! But I love that we get to pause and have this conversation.”
This humanizes the interaction, making it genuine rather than transactional. Make it authentic, not 
something you prepare upfront.

Introduce Yourself & Points of You®

After a few minutes of informal bonding, it’s time to shift the focus and introduce yourself as well as 
Points of You®. You can say something like:
“So, I’d love to share a bit about myself and Points of You® before we dive into your world.”

At this point:
1.  Introduce Yourself (Briefly, 1-2 minutes)

–  Name & role (e.g., “I’m Yaron Golan, a Points of You® Certified Business Trainer and coach with a 

background in psychology and business management.”)

–  A small personal note (e.g., “And most importantly, I’m a father of three boys!”)

2.  Introduce Points of You® (Max 5 minutes)

–  “Points of You® is a unique methodology that bridges the gap between the left and right brain, 
blending structured learning with creative exploration. Our approach is designed to help 
organizations improve communication, strengthen emotional intelligence, and enhance creativity 
by creating spaces where participants can open up, share, be heard, and truly listen.  
We offer hands-on experiential workshops that engage teams in meaningful conversations, 
professional training programs that develop leadership and coaching skills, and custom experiential 
toolkits tailored to support corporate learning and organizational growth.”

Used in 147 countries and available in 30+ languages, our tools have been implemented by 
leading companies such as Google, Intel, and NASA.
(This can be supported by a simple slide or a one-pager if presenting online.)

Shifting to the Questioning Stage

Once you’ve introduced yourself and Points of You®, transition the conversation towards the client’s needs:
Example bridging sentence:
“So that was a little about us, but I’d love to hear more about you and your organization – what’s on your 
mind?”

This opens the floor for the client to share their current challenges and needs, leading seamlessly into the 
next phase of the meeting.

[ 239 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Stage 2: Questioning

Goal: At this stage, the focus shifts to active listening and understanding. The objective is to gather 
essential insights about the conversation partner – whether an HR leader, L&D manager, or another 
organizational decision-maker.

This is the time to step back, give them space, and create an environment where they feel comfortable 
sharing. Our role is to:
-  Be fully present  –  Observe non-verbal cues, listen closely to their words, tone, and expressions.
-  Ask the right questions  –  Help them articulate their organizational needs, challenges, and 

aspirations.

-  Use reflective listening  –  Rephrase and confirm their statements to show understanding.

Setting the Tone

Begin the conversation with an open invitation:
“I’d love to hear more about your role and what’s important for you in your organization this year? What 
are some of your key focus areas?”

This allows them to freely express themselves, focusing on their priorities and challenges for the 
upcoming year, setting the stage for a deeper conversation.

Understanding Their Organization and Context

Now that they’ve introduced themselves, shift towards understanding their organization’s landscape and 
key needs.

Uncovering Organizational Priorities and Challenges

“I’d love to hear about some of the challenges you and your organization are currently facing – whether 
in leadership, employee engagement, or team development.”

Our role is to help them articulate their needs, whether they relate to:
-  Leadership challenges such as engagement, retention, or communication.
-  Training gaps where managers struggle to develop soft skills.
-  Team development issues, including collaboration, innovation, or employee well-being.
-  Broader organizational challenges, such as cultural shifts or change management.

[ 240 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Key Context for the Interviewer
-  If the client shares a personal challenge in their role (such as their own leadership struggles or 

navigating team issues), this is an opportunity to build rapport and become their partner in solving it.

-  If they describe a wider challenge affecting their managers or employees, guide the discussion 
towards understanding what’s missing in their current learning and development approach.

-  In both cases, the approach should be one of curiosity, asking open-ended questions, and allowing 
them to lead the discussion while uncovering potential gaps where Points of You® could add value.

Follow-Up Questions to Dig Deeper

Before diving deeper, it’s important to set the tone for this part of the conversation. We want them to feel 
comfortable exploring their challenges openly without pressure.

“I really appreciate everything you’ve shared so far. If it’s okay with you, I’d love to use my experience 
and resources to help you explore this further. Whether we end up working together or not, my goal is to 
bring as much value as possible to this conversation. Let’s take a few minutes to reflect on this together – 
does that sound good to you?”

This ensures that:
-  They feel safe to open up.
-  It doesn’t feel like we are selling – instead, we are supporting them.
-  It shows genuine care and partnership. 

Once we have their permission to explore, we move into deeper questions:
-  How long has this been an issue?
-  What have you tried so far to solve it?
-  What impact is this challenge having on employees, managers, or the organization?
-  What do you believe needs to happen to improve the situation?
-  What obstacles are preventing this change from happening? 

If responses remain surface-level, encourage deeper sharing by asking:
-  That’s interesting – can you tell me more about that?
-  Let me check if I understood correctly – what you’re saying is… (paraphrase). Is that right?
-  You mentioned [specific point] – why do you think that is happening? 

These techniques help uncover hidden insights while ensuring the conversation remains collaborative 
and engaging.

Transitioning to the Experience Stage

Once the conversation has uncovered key needs and gaps, transition smoothly into an experiential 
session that allows them to experience the impact of Points of You® firsthand.

[ 241 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

“Thank you for sharing. I already have a lot of ideas on how we might work together, but before I share 
them, I’d love to invite you to experience one of our tools.”

Introducing Speak Up
“Speak Up is an interactive tool designed to open up new perspectives through visual metaphors, 
powerful words, and thought-provoking questions. It’s structured to spark meaningful conversations and 
reveal insights that might not be immediately visible.”

“Let’s do a short experience together. You can choose to focus on something we just discussed or any 
other topic you’d like to explore further. I’ll guide you through the process, and my goal is for you to gain 
at least one valuable insight from it.”

“What do you say? Let’s give it a try.”

Stage 3: Experience

The Experience Stage is where we shift from discussion to immersion  –  allowing the participant to 
experience firsthand how Points of You® creates insights and deep conversations. Rather than just 
talking about solutions, we guide them through a reflective process that helps them see their challenges, 
opportunities, and next steps in a new way.

Through this guided experience, they will connect with their thoughts, explore different perspectives, 
and gain clarity – whether or not we move forward together. The focus is not on selling but on creating a 
meaningful and memorable interaction.

Step 1: Choosing a Photo Card

The facilitator spreads out the Speak Up photo cards in front of the participant or opens the Speak Up 
digital layout chart if using a virtual format. The participant is invited to select a photo card from the deck.

Facilitator’s Instructions:
“Take a look at the images in front of you. If there were no limitations – if you had unlimited resources, 
full creative freedom, and no external constraints – what would the ideal solution to your challenge look 
like?”

[ 242 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Encourage them to think beyond their usual boundaries:
-  Imagine there are no budget restrictions, no HQ approvals, and you can hire or restructure teams as 

needed. Anything is possible.

-  Let yourself be drawn to an image – whether it’s the colors, themes, or even something that feels 
missing. You can go through them one by one or choose intuitively – whatever speaks to you. 

Once the participant selects a card, guide them in exploring their choice:
-  “What stands out to you in this image?”
-  “How does this image connect to the challenge you are facing?”
-  “What does this tell you about the solution you are looking for?” 

If relevant, the facilitator can offer a gentle reflection, linking their selection to earlier insights from the 
conversation, and inviting them to expand on their thoughts.

Step 2: Adding a Word Card – Moving Toward Action

After reflecting on the photo card, the participant is guided to choose a word card – but this time, face 
down, so it is selected randomly.

Facilitator’s Instructions:
“Now, let’s take this one step further. The photo gave us insight into your ideal solution – now let’s look at 
the next step. In front of you is a deck of word cards, but this time, we will select one without looking.”
“Once you pick a card, let’s explore how it connects to your image and your journey forward.”

[ 243 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Once they reveal their word card, guide the discussion:
-  What is your first reaction to this word?
-  How does it connect to your photo card?
-  Does this word offer a new perspective on your challenge or the solution you envisioned? 

Now, bringing it to action:
“Looking at both your photo and this word – what does this tell you about the next step?”
“What is one small action that you can take to move closer to your solution?”
“What would help you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to be?”

This is key: We don’t want them to leave the conversation only in the fantasy of possibilities; we anchor it 
in movement.

If they struggle to connect the word to a clear next step, guide them:
-  If you had to take one step toward your ideal situation, what would it be?
-  How can this word serve as a reminder or guide for that next step? 

If they feel the word doesn’t fit, offer them the possibility to switch:
“If this word doesn’t quite resonate, you’re welcome to pick another one – sometimes, a different word 
reveals a new angle. But before you do, let’s see if we can find a connection together.”

The facilitator can also:
-  Read a quote from the book related to the word, if relevant.
-  Offer a simple question from the book that deepens reflection.

Step 3: Concluding the Experience

As the participant reflects on both the photo and word connection, guide them toward consolidating their 
insight into action.

Facilitator’s Instructions:
“This was a short experience, but we can already see how powerful it is when we step back and explore 
challenges visually. What is one insight you are taking from this?”

Acknowledge the depth of the conversation:
“Thank you for sharing and for going deep into this process. It’s not always easy to pause and reflect in 
this way.”

Before moving into the guiding stage, set the context:
“What we just experienced was just a glimpse of what’s possible. In our longer programs, we can dive 
even deeper – sometimes over several days – to create real, lasting transformation. Based on what we 
explored, I have some ideas for how we can continue this journey together.”
This naturally transitions into the Guiding Stage, where recommendations and next steps are discussed.

[ 244 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Stage 4: Guiding

Goal: Connecting the Dots

At this stage, we shift from exploration to action – translating insights from the Experience Stage into a 
clear, relevant solution for the client.

The participant has now expressed their challenges, reflected on them through the Speak Up experience, 
and gained insights about their situation. Now, we offer a pathway forward using Points of You® solutions.

The purpose of this stage is to:
-  Show them that a solution exists.
-  Connect their pain points to the potential impact of our approach.
-  Create excitement and curiosity about working together.
-  Provide a first idea of what a collaboration could look like. 

This is where we position ourselves as a strategic partner rather than just a service provider.

Presenting the Solution

Rather than offering a generic pitch, we tailor the approach based on the conversation.

“From everything we've discussed today, I see a few ways we could move forward together. Let me share 
some initial thoughts with you.”

Depending on the situation, we frame our solution in one of three ways:

1.  Experiential Workshops – Learning Through Doing

“One way we could approach this is through an interactive, hands-on workshop that directly 
addresses [insert challenge they mentioned].”

Workshops are designed to:
-  Create impactful learning experiences that are highly engaging.
-  Encourage personal and team reflection through Points of You® tools.
-  Support leadership and communication skills development in a safe and creative environment.
-  Generate immediate takeaways that participants can apply in their work. 

[ 245 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

“For example, we could design a one-day experience for your leadership team to help them explore 
[insert relevant theme] in a way that is meaningful and transformative.”

2.  Professional Trainings – Teaching Them the Tools

“If you're looking for something deeper, we could consider a training program – where instead of just 
delivering an experience, we teach your managers how to apply these tools themselves.”

Professional training is ideal when:
-  The organization wants an ongoing learning process rather than a one-time experience.
-  The client is interested in building an internal capacity for coaching, communication, and team 

development.

-  There’s a need to empower HR, managers, or leaders to create change inside their teams. 

“For example, we could run a program where we train HR professionals and team leaders to use 
Points of You® methodologies within their organization, helping them to integrate creative thinking 
and deep conversations into their leadership approach.”

3.  Developing Organizational Toolkits – Customized Solutions

“Another way we could work together is by developing a custom toolkit – something designed 
specifically for your organization, aligned with your culture and strategic goals.”

This is particularly relevant when:
-  The company wants a long-term impact and not just a single event.
-  They have specific organizational needs that require a tailored solution.
-  They value internal ownership, meaning they want their people to have structured tools they can 

use consistently. 

“For example, we could design a series of conversation tools that managers in your company can use 
during team meetings to improve communication and alignment.”

Guiding the Discussion – Refining the Offer

At this point, we open the conversation rather than just presenting a fixed package.
“I see a lot of potential in these directions. What resonates with you the most?”

This allows them to:
-  Share their initial reaction.
-  Express preferences or concerns.
-  Refine the direction to ensure the solution feels relevant to them. 

If they seem unsure, we guide the conversation with more direct questions:
-  “What type of format do you think would work best for your team?”

[ 246 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

-  “Are you looking for a solution that is quick and impactful, or something more long-term?”
-  “Do you see this as something for a small leadership group, or something that could eventually 

expand to more teams?”

The goal is to co-create the idea rather than just selling something pre-packaged.

Understanding the Scope and Next Steps

Once the discussion starts shaping into a direction, we sense the scope of collaboration and explore next 
steps.

1.  If it’s a one-time workshop, confirm details and try to seal it on the spot.

“It sounds like a workshop could be a great way to introduce this approach to your team. If this 
makes sense, we can start looking at possible dates and structure.”
If there’s enthusiasm, lock it in immediately rather than postponing decisions.

2.  If it’s a bigger program, define the next step.

“If this is something that could be part of a broader initiative, I’d love to develop a structured plan 
and present it to you. Would it make sense to schedule a follow-up to refine the details?”
This shows commitment without pressure, allowing them to think through logistics.

3.  If it requires internal discussions on their end, set a follow-up point.
“I know these decisions often require internal alignment. Would it be helpful if I sent you a brief outline of 
what we discussed so you can easily share it with your team?”

Proactive Tip: Instead of waiting for them to relay the information, offer to be part of the follow-up 
meetings.
“I’d be happy to join your next discussion with key decision-makers to present the approach firsthand and 
answer any questions. That way, we can ensure everyone has the clarity they need.”

By staying engaged in their internal process, the conversation remains active rather than stalling, 
increasing the chances of a successful outcome.

Creating Excitement and Momentum

We want them to leave this stage feeling energized and optimistic about the potential collaboration.
-  Show belief in the solution:

“I genuinely believe that this could create a real shift in how your team approaches [specific 
challenge].”

-  Show flexibility and partnership:

“I want to make sure this fits your needs perfectly, so we can refine things together as we move 
forward.”

-  Show enthusiasm for next steps:

“I’m really excited about the possibilities here. Let’s set a time to finalize how we want to proceed.”

[ 247 ]

Table of Contents  >

Final Transition – Moving Toward Closing Deal Stage

“I really appreciate this conversation, and I see a lot of exciting potential in working together. What would 
be the best way for you to move forward from here?”
This gently moves them toward making a decision, whether it’s a firm commitment, a follow-up, or a 
structured next step.

Stage 5: Closing Deal

Goal: Creating Clarity and Defining Next Steps.

Closing the deal is not just about getting a “yes.” The most important outcome of this stage is clarity – 
understanding where the client stands and ensuring both sides agree on the next steps, whatever they 
may be.

Regardless of the outcome, we leave the meeting with alignment and a positive connection.

Guiding the Decision: Yes, No, or Not Now

If the client is interested and ready to move forward, we clarify the next steps:
-  For a workshop or training:

“Great! Let's look at scheduling dates and finalizing details.”

-  For a larger collaboration:

“Would it be helpful if I put together a detailed proposal so we can refine it further?”

-  If they need internal approval:

“What’s the best way to support you in presenting this internally?”

If the client expresses hesitation:
-  Budget concerns:

“I completely understand budget constraints. If this approach makes sense for your team, we can 
explore different options – whether that’s a phased approach or a pilot program to start small.”

-  Timing concerns:

“I get that timing is everything. If now isn’t the right moment, when do you think would be a better 
time to revisit?”

-  Uncertainty about value:

“Would it be helpful to share more examples of how other organizations have used this to drive 
impact?”

[ 248 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

If the answer is a clear “no”, that’s also a great outcome:
-  “I appreciate your honesty. Even if this isn’t the right fit today, I’d love to stay in touch and see how 

things evolve in the future.”

-  “Let’s keep the door open for later. If something changes, I’d be happy to reconnect.”

The key is to leave on a positive note – even a “no” today can be a “yes” later.

Understanding Decision Timelines

Different organizations have different decision-making processes:
-  Small organizations can often make faster decisions and move forward quickly.
-  Larger organizations tend to require more time – sometimes months or even a year – due to internal 

approval processes. 

Finding the balance:
-  For small organizations:

– 
– 

If they’re ready, close the deal on the spot.
If they need a little more time, set a clear follow-up timeline.

-  For larger organizations:

–  Understand their approval process and key decision-makers.
–  Offer to provide additional materials or follow-up meetings to help move things forward.
–  Be patient but proactive – stay in touch without being overly pushy.

In an ideal situation, you should have a mix of small and large clients:
-  Small projects → Bring immediate results and early success.
-  Bigger partnerships → Take longer but offer long-term growth and impact.

Final Transition & Follow-Up Strategy

Before closing, we clarify next steps based on the conversation:
“This has been a really valuable discussion. I want to make sure we move forward in a way that makes 
the most sense for you. What’s the best next step from here?”

Depending on their response:
1. 
2. 
3. 

If moving forward → Confirm details immediately.
If needing time → Set a clear follow-up.
If they say no → Keep the relationship open for future engagement.

After the meeting, always follow up – whether to confirm next steps, send materials, or simply express 
gratitude for the conversation.

Dealing with Resistance – Organizational Context

Resistance is a Positive Sign
When organizations express resistance, it’s not a rejection – it’s an opportunity. Resistance often means 
they are engaging in the decision-making process and seeking clarity before making a commitment.

A company that raises concerns, challenges pricing, or asks tough questions is demonstrating interest. 
The real sales conversation begins when resistance appears – it means they are actively considering the 
investment.

Our role is to:
1.  Acknowledge and welcome their concerns.
2.  Understand the reason behind the hesitation.
3.  Provide clarity, confidence, and reassurance.

Understanding the Types of Resistance in Organizations

Resistance can come from different levels of decision-makers in an organization. It’s important to identify 
whether it’s:
-  Budget-related – The company is concerned about financial investment.
-  Relevance-related – They don’t fully see how it applies to their needs.
-  Approval-related – They need internal buy-in from leadership or HR.

Common Forms of Resistance & How to Approach Them:

[ 250 ]

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Resistance

What It Really Means How to Address It

“We need to 
consult with 
the leadership 
team.”

They may need 
internal buy-in or a 
higher-level decisionmaker to approve it.

  Offer to provide a short business case or summary for 

internal discussions.

  Ask, “Would it be helpful if I joined your next leadership 

discussion to address any questions firsthand?”

  Identify who the key decision-makers are and how they 

evaluate solutions.

“We need to 
think about it.”

They may lack 
confidence in the 
decision, or this may 
be a polite way of 
saying no because 
they don’t fully see 
the value.

  Ask, “What exactly do you need to think about? Is there 

something that’s unclear?”

  Ensure they understand the real value of what we’re 

offering – help them connect it to their needs.

  Ask, “If it were up to you to decide, do you think this 

program/workshop would be beneficial?”

  Based on their response, determine if it’s a true hesitation 

or a lack of perceived value.

“It’s too 
expensive.”

They recognize the 
value but are unsure 
if they can justify the 
cost.

  Reframe the investment: “I understand budget 

constraints. Let’s explore how we can align this with your 
priorities – whether that’s a phased approach, a pilot 
program, or flexible payment options.”

“We already 
have training 
programs in 
place.”

They don’t yet see 
the differentiation 
between their current 
programs and what 
you offer.

“We’re shifting 
priorities right 
now.”

The organization 
may be dealing with 
internal changes and 
unsure if this is the 
right time.

  Shift the focus: “Let’s put the budget aside for a moment 
– do you believe this solution will truly work for your 
organization?”

  This helps determine if the real issue is cost or if they 

don’t fully see the impact yet.

rather than replaces them.

  Provide case studies or success stories of similar 

organizations that integrated Points of You®.

  Ask, “How do you currently measure the success of your 
programs? Would it be valuable to explore new ways to 
enhance them?”

  Keep the conversation open: “I completely 

understand. When would be a better time to revisit this 
conversation?”

  Offer support: “From experience, major shifts can 

bring challenges. We’ve helped organizations in similar 
transitions – would it be helpful to explore how we can 
support your teams during this time?”

  This approach positions us as a partner,  

not just a service provider.

What NOT to Do When Facing Resistance

1.  Panic or become defensive – Resistance is normal and part of the process.
2.  Argue or push too hard – Instead, listen and adapt.
3.  Dismiss concerns – Every question is a sign of interest and deserves a thoughtful response.

What TO Do When Facing Resistance

1.  Stay calm and lean back. Don’t rush to fix it – let them express their concerns fully.
2.  Listen deeply. Ask clarifying questions to understand their real concerns.
3.  Show empathy. Acknowledge their hesitation and align with their perspective.
4.  Clarify if the resistance is real or just hesitation. Sometimes, concerns are simply a need for 

reassurance rather than a real barrier.

5.  Reflect back what you hear. “I hear that you're concerned about the timing – let's talk about what 

would make this work for you.”

6.  Provide a relevant answer or solution. Adapt based on what they need.
7.  Go for closing again. If resistance is addressed, ask: “If we could find a way to align this with your 

needs, would you be open to moving forward?”

How Many Times Should You Address Resistance?

It’s common for organizations to raise concerns multiple times before making a final decision. A good 
rule is:
-  Overcome resistance at least three times before considering it a hard “no.”
-  If resistance continues, agree to revisit at a later date while keeping the relationship warm.

Closing Techniques for Organizations

1.  Agree on the principle.

“We both agree that leadership development is important – now it’s just about finding the right 
approach.”
If… then… structure.
“If we can create a solution that fits within your budget, would you be open to moving forward?”

2. 

3.  Use success stories.

“Other organizations we’ve worked with had similar concerns, and now they’re seeing great results 
after implementing this.”

4.  Show confidence.

“I trust our approach enough to say – trust me, this will bring real impact.”

Final Thoughts – Shifting from Resistance to Opportunity

Resistance is not a rejection – it’s part of the natural process of making a thoughtful decision.
The goal is not just to overcome objections but to guide the organization toward clarity – whether that 
means moving forward now, later, or simply staying connected for future opportunities.

Recording

Below you can see a demo example of the Marketing Meeting conducted by Yaron during the BTC 
Session with one of our participants:

Chapter 8 – MarketingTable of Contents  >

Follow-Up

The Follow-Up stage is where we turn interest into action and relationships into long-term partnerships. 
It’s not just about closing deals – it’s about nurturing connections, building trust, and staying top of mind, 
even if the client isn’t ready right now.
The follow-up process has two key tracks:

1.  Closing the deal

For clients who showed strong interest and want to move forward.

2.  Nurturing relationships

For clients who said “not now” but may be interested in the future.

Let’s break down how to handle both situations effectively.

Closing the Deal – Turning Interest into Commitment

A client makes a decision not just based on the offer, but based on the relationship and trust they have in 
us. They need to believe that:
-  We walk the talk and can deliver what we promise.
-  We are professionals they can rely on.
-  The investment is worth it for their organization.
To strengthen the relationship after the Marketing Meeting, we must:

Step 1: Immediate Follow-Up – Strengthening the Connection

-  Send a thank-you email or WhatsApp message within 24-48 hours.
-  Acknowledge the conversation, their insights, and the potential of working together.
-  Express excitement about the possibilities and confirm you will follow up with an official offer.

Example Follow-Up Message (WhatsApp or Email)
"Hi [Name], I really enjoyed our conversation today – thank you for sharing your insights! I see great 
potential in how we can work together, and I’m excited to explore the next steps. I’ll be sending you a 
summary of our discussion along with an offer shortly. Looking forward to your thoughts!"

Step 2: Sending the Official Offer

The proposal should summarize the key takeaways from the meeting and clearly outline the next steps.
The Proposal Should Include:
-  Reaffirm the client’s challenge – What they shared as their needs.
-  The proposed solution – Whether it’s a workshop, professional training, or a customized toolkit.
-  The value proposition – How Points of You® can solve their challenge.
-  Pricing & options – Always start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Tip:
After sending the proposal via email, follow up with a WhatsApp message to make sure they’ve received it.
"Hi [Name], I’ve just sent you the proposal – looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

Step 3: Handling Multiple Decision-Makers

Sometimes, the person we spoke with is not the final decision-maker. They might need internal buy-in 
from leadership or approval from procurement. Deals often stall here if we don’t support them in this 
process.

-  Offer to join their internal discussions:

"Would it help if I joined a meeting with your leadership team to present the approach firsthand?"

-  Provide an internal summary deck:

Prepare a one-pager summarizing key points for internal decision-makers.

-  Ask about their decision process:

"Who else should be involved in this discussion to make it happen?"

This ensures the deal keeps moving and doesn’t get lost in internal approvals.

Step 4: Creating Urgency Without Pressure

Some clients want to move forward but don’t have a clear timeline – and without urgency, the deal can 
lose momentum.

-  Use limited-time incentives:

"If we finalize by [date], we can offer an additional training session for your managers at no extra 
cost."

-   Align with internal events:

"Would it make sense to schedule this alongside your next leadership retreat or annual strategy 
session?"

-  Position it as a strategic priority:

"From our experience, organizations that act now see better results because they implement insights 
while they’re fresh."

This helps prevent delays while ensuring the client feels in control of their decision-making process.

Step 5:  Handling Negotiations & Closing the Deal

Not every client says yes immediately. It’s important to:
-  Understand what they need to say yes.
-  Ask the right questions to move toward a decision.
-  Be flexible in structuring the first step.

Example Follow-Up Questions for Closing the Deal:
“What do you need to move forward?”
“What would make this a clear yes for you?”
“Would a pilot program help your team experience the impact first?”

Tip: If there’s resistance, offer a small entry point – even a short session – to get a foot in the door.

Nurturing Relationships – Keeping the Door Open

Some clients say "not now", but that doesn’t mean "never." The goal is to stay on their radar without being 
pushy.

Structured Follow-up:  How Often to Reach Out?

Many deals stall not because of lack of interest, but because follow-ups are inconsistent. Suggested 
Follow-Up Timeline:

-  Immediately after the meeting – Thank-you email + WhatsApp.
-  Within 3-5 days – Send the proposal.
-  After 7-10 days – If no response, a polite check-in: “Just checking if you had a chance to review the 

proposal. Happy to answer any questions!”

-  After 3 weeks – If still no response, reposition: “I understand things get busy! Would it make sense to 

revisit this next month?”

-  Every 3-6 months for nurturing contacts – Share relevant insights, webinar invites, or success stories to 

stay in touch.

A structured follow-up plan ensures no opportunities are lost due to inactivity.

Stay in Touch Strategically

-  Send occasional check-ins – A short message to see how they’re doing.
-  Invite them to webinars or events – Keep them engaged with valuable content.
-  Share relevant updates – If something aligns with their interests, send it their way.

Example Follow-Up Message for a “Not Now” Client
"Hi [Name], I wanted to check in and see how things are going on your end. No pressure at all – just 
wanted to keep in touch. I also wanted to invite you to [event/webinar] that I think you’d find valuable. 
Let me know if you’d like more details!"

Case Studies & Social Proof in Follow-Ups

Some clients need extra confidence before saying yes.

-  Share client success stories:

"A similar company implemented this and saw [specific results]."

-  Use credibility markers:

"This approach is used by companies like Google, Intel, and NASA."

-  Offer a reference call:

"Would you like to speak with another organization that has used this program?"

This reassures the client that they are making a well-informed decision.

Avoid Wasting Resources on “Maybe” Clients

Be aware of false hope. Some clients don’t want to say no, but they also won’t commit. This creates a 
situation where we keep following up with no clear outcome.

-  Get clear answers – A clear "no" is better than an endless "maybe."
-  Don’t waste resources on fantasy deals – If a client consistently delays, it’s best to redirect efforts 

elsewhere.

-  If they’re not ready now, move them to the nurturing track.

How to Politely Push for Clarity:
"I completely understand if the timing isn’t right now. Just so I can plan on my end – would you say this is 
something to revisit in a few months, or is it not the right fit at all?"

A clear no allows you to move on and focus on other clients.

Key Takeaways

-  Follow up quickly after the marketing meeting – don’t let interest fade.
-  The client buys into YOU first, then the offer – build trust.
-  Send a strong proposal that aligns with their needs.
-  Negotiate smartly and offer smaller entry points if needed.
-  If they say “not now,” keep the relationship warm without being pushy.
-  Avoid getting stuck in false "maybes" – get clear answers.

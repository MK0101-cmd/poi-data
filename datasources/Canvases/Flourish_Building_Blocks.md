# Flourish – Building Blocks

## Objective
Based on Martin Seligman’s Framework for Well-being, this process invites you to reflect on:  
- **Two foundational elements** (Questions 1 & 2)  
- **Three complementary elements** (Questions 3, 4 & 5)  

Together, they amplify your sense of flourishing and fulfillment.

## The Five Elements of Flourishing
These are elements you already possess and can continue to harness.  
Each improves your well-being, pursued for their own sake, and measured by your own experience.

1. **Positive Emotion** – When am I most connected to feeling satisfied?  
2. **Engagement** – What puts me in a state of flow?  
3. **Relationships** – Who are the people that lift me up?  
4. **Meaning** – What greater purpose am I contributing to?  
5. **Accomplishment** – What gives me a sense of having achieved?

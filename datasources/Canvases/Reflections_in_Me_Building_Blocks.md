# Reflections in Me – Building Blocks

## Objective
Use this layout chart to observe what your **unconscious** is inviting you to reflect on through a photo you took.

---

## Before We Start
Think of the word **Reflection**.  
What does it mean to you?  
Take a photo that represents *Reflection* for you — this photo will be used in the process.

---

## Pause
Take a deep breath, close your eyes, and connect to yourself.  
When you are ready, open your eyes and place your chosen photo in the layout chart.

---

## Cards / Prompts
Use your photo as the reflective anchor.  
Each prompt corresponds to a reflective question:

1. What do I see in the photo? How does it link to where I am now?  
2. What is outside the “frame”? How does it link to what I am not seeing about myself?  
3. How does the photo make me feel? How does it link to how I feel about myself?  
4. When I link the photo with the word “Reflection,” what do I want to bring into my life to live more fully?

## Expanding
Observe your photo deeply.  
Notice details, associations, and metaphors it evokes.  
Let it guide your reflection on the unconscious themes it reveals.

---

## Focus & Action
Write down your **insights and observations**.  
Define **3 actions** that will move you forward:  
- One for today  
- One for next week  
- One for the upcoming month

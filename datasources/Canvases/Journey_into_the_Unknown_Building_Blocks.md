# Journey into the Unknown – Building Blocks

## Objective
In life we often begin journeys into the **unknown** — a new job, relationship, home, or situation.  
This process helps you explore what drives and motivates you during such changes.

## Pause
Stop and take a deep breath.  
Think about an issue in your life where you are heading into the unknown.  
Reflect on these steps:  
1. **Facing the unknown** – What is holding me back? What do I fear?  
2. **My strengths** – What can I control? What strengths from past experiences do I bring?  
3. **Vision** – What do I take with me into the unknown?

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **5 cards** (face up or face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. How do I feel in the unknown?  
2. What worries me in the unknown?  
3. What can I control?  
4. What gives me strength?  
5. What do I decide to take with me into the unknown?

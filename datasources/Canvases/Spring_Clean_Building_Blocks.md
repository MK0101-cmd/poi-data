# Spring Clean â€“ Building Blocks

## Objective
As the seasons change, it is a natural time to pause and reflect.  
This process helps you clarify what you want to focus on in the upcoming cycle.

Take a moment to breathe deeply and close your eyes.  
Notice where you are with yourself.  
When ready, open your eyes and begin the new season with clarity and focus.

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (face up or face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

## Expanding
Observe the chosen cards and explore your reflections.  
Answer each question in relation to the photo and word on each card.  
If stuck, consult the book of the tool for inspiration.

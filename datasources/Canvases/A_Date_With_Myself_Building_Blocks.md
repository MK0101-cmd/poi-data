# A Date With Myself – Building Blocks

## Objective
A meeting with yourself.  
Create space for self-reflection and clarity.

---

## Pause
Before starting the process, begin with a mindful pause.  
Questions to ask yourself:
- How am I feeling?  
- What thoughts are coming and going?  
- When was the last time I paused?

This sets the tone before reflection begins.

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (randomly, openly, or from personal photos).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. What isn’t working in my life right now?  
2. What works in my life right now?  
3. If everything is possible, what should I wish for my life right now?

## Expand & Connect
Use the chosen cards to explore deeper insights.  
The cards act as metaphors to unlock perspectives and connections.

## Focus & Action
Write down the main insights you have reached.  
Define **3 concrete actions**:
- One for the coming day  
- One for the next week  
- One for the coming month

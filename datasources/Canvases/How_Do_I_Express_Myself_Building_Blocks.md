# How Do I Express Myself? â€“ Building Blocks

## Objective
To observe the **gap between who we are on the inside and how we express ourselves on the outside**.

---

## Pause
Take a mindful moment.  
Reflect on the question: *How can I reduce the gap between inner self and outer expression?*

---

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (randomly, openly, or from personal photos).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. How do I see/perceive myself?  
2. How do others see/perceive me?  
3. How would I like others to see/perceive me?

---

## Expanding
Observe the chosen cards carefully.  
Ask yourself: *How can these cards help me answer the questions?*  
Use them as metaphors to connect inner and outer perspectives.

---

## Focus & Action
Write down your **main insights**.  
Define **3 concrete actions** to express these insights in practice and advance toward a better year:  
- One for the next 24 hours  
- One for next week  
- One for the coming month

# Building Communities – Building Blocks

## Objective
Any community we create is about **reciprocity, giving, and receiving** so that we can belong and feel supported by one another.  
This process helps you reflect on what is important for you in the communities that you co-create.

---

## Pause
Close your eyes and take a deep breath.  
Imagine how you want to feel as part of the community.  
Visualize yourself surrounded by others — how do you interact, and what do you bring?

---

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (face up or face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. What do I give to the community?  
2. What do I want to gain in the community?  
3. What allows me to feel belonging?

---

## Expanding
Use the chosen cards to expand your reflection.  
Answer each question in relation to the photo and text on each card.

---

## Focus & Action
Write down your **main insights**.  
Define **3 actions** you will take in your community:
- One for today  
- One by the end of the week  
- One by the end of the month  

Enjoy and good luck!

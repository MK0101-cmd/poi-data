# Strong Relationships – Building Blocks

## Objective
Key elements of strong relationships are **communication** and truly **understanding each other’s points of view**.  
This process helps you and your significant other explore and connect more deeply while spending meaningful time together.

## Pause
Close your eyes and take a deep breath.  
Imagine your relationship, how it grows, and how you become stronger together.  
When ready, open your eyes.

---

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (face up or face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:  

1. What do I give in the relationship?  
2. What does my significant other give in the relationship?  
3. What is the energy of our relationship?  

*(When working with your significant other, answer questions 1 & 2 separately, then explore question 3 together.)*

---

## Expanding
Observe the chosen cards carefully.  
Answer each question in relation to the photo and text on each card.  
Allow space for open sharing with your partner.

---

## Focus & Action
Write down your **main insights**.  
Define **3 actions** to bring into your relationship:  
- One for today  
- One by the end of the week  
- One by the end of the month  

Enjoy and good luck!

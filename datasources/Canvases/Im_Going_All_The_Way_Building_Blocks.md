# I'm Going All The Way – Building Blocks

## Objective
Clarify your life goals and check within yourself what needs to be done to actually implement them.

---

## Pause
Choose an important goal you hope to achieve.  
The goal can be in any area of life — personal relationships, parenting, work, money, etc.  
Clearly write down your goal.  
Examples:  
- I want to earn at least $15,000 a month.  
- I want to be in a personal relationship.

---

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (randomly, openly, or from personal photos).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. What brings me closer to my goal?  
2. What’s preventing/stopping me from achieving my goal?  
3. What do I need to express in order to achieve my goal?

---

## Expanding
Use the chosen cards to explore deeper insights.  
Ask yourself: *How can these cards help me answer the questions?*  
Let the images guide your reflection.

---

## Focus & Action
Write down your **main insights**.  
Define **3 concrete actions** that will help move you toward your goal:  
- One for the next 24 hours  
- One for next week  
- One for the coming month

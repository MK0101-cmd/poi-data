**Case Study 1:\
Transforming Performance Conversations with Points of You®**

**A. Introduction**

**Organization Overview**\
An international company in the food and beverage industry, employing
over 4,200 people worldwide, sought to enhance its **Performance
Development Plan (PDP)** process.\
This annual process includes structured conversations aimed at
evaluating employee performance, setting goals, and driving continuous
improvement.

**Challenge**\
While PDP conversations were integral to the company's development
framework, they often felt mechanical and superficial.\
Managers struggled to provide meaningful feedback, especially when
addressing sensitive topics or performance gaps. Employees, on the other
hand,\
felt these sessions lacked personal connection and actionable outcomes.
The organization recognized the need to transform these conversations
into\
impactful experiences that would strengthen manager-employee
relationships, foster engagement, and drive better performance results.

**B. Approach**

**Solution**\
Points of You® partnered with the company to embed its innovative tools
into the PDP process. The aim was to shift the conversations from
routine evaluations to meaningful dialogues,\
enabling deeper reflections and fostering a culture of growth and
accountability.

**Process**

1.  **Understanding the Existing Framework**\
    Points of You® began by analyzing the company's PDP process, which
    consisted of:

    -   **Beginning-of-year conversations**: Goal setting.

    -   **Mid-year conversations**: Progress reviews.

    -   **End-of-year conversations**: Performance evaluations and bonus
        determinations.

> These sessions were crucial for aligning individual performance with
> organizational goals. However, they lacked the depth needed\
> to inspire true employee engagement and development.

2.  **Developing a Custom Template**\
    A tailored approach was created to integrate Points of You® tools
    into the PDP process, including:

    -   **Dialogue Starters**:\
        Pre-designed prompts to initiate deeper, more reflective
        conversations.

    -   **Three-Card Process**:\
        Managers and employees worked with three photo cards to explore
        achievements, challenges, and aspirations.

3.  **Introducing the Speak Up Toolkit**\
    The **Speak Up toolkit** was introduced as a supporting framework.
    This set of tools provided managers with practical guidance on
    facilitating PDP conversations,\
    offering templates and examples to ensure consistency and depth.

4.  **Training Managers**\
    A comprehensive training program was developed, combining theory and
    practice:

    -   Managers first experienced the process as participants, gaining
        personal insights.

    -   They then practiced facilitating conversations with their peers,
        receiving feedback and refining their approach.

**C. Results**

**Outcomes**

1.  **Stronger Manager-Employee Connections**\
    Conversations evolved from formal evaluations to open, trust-based
    dialogues, fostering stronger relationships.

2.  **Improved Feedback Quality**\
    Managers felt more confident and equipped to provide constructive,
    actionable feedback, even in challenging situations.

3.  **Increased Employee Engagement**\
    Employees reported feeling more seen and valued, which boosted their
    motivation and alignment with organizational goals.

**Participant Feedback**\
*\"For the first time, these conversations felt real and meaningful. I
left the session with a clearer sense of direction and a stronger
connection with my manager.\"*

**D. Conclusion**

**Impact**\
The integration of Points of You® tools into the PDP process transformed
routine evaluations into engaging, meaningful conversations, enhancing
both individual and organizational growth.

**Next Steps**\
The company plans to extend the use of Points of You® tools and the
SpeakUp toolbox to other areas, including:

-   **Team meetings**

-   **Leadership development programs**

-   **Onboarding processes**

-   **Ongoing employee development initiatives**

Case Study 2:\
Fostering Connection and Vision in a Global Pharmaceutical Company**

**A. Introduction**

**Organization Overview**\
A leading international pharmaceutical company, with a workforce of
approximately 80,000 employees worldwide, organized a three-day retreat
for 160 employees.\
These employees came from diverse departments, including engineering,
product management, maintenance, and logistics.\
The retreat was part of the company's efforts to celebrate a significant
milestone and strengthen internal collaboration.

**Challenge**\
The retreat had two primary goals:

1.  **Foster Connection**:\
    Bring together employees from different departments to build
    stronger relationships and encourage collaboration.

2.  **Set Vision for the Future**:\
    Provide a platform for employees to reflect on the past year's
    achievements and create personal vision boards for the upcoming
    year.

The challenge was to design an engaging and impactful experience for
such a large and diverse group, ensuring active participation and
meaningful outcomes.

**B. Approach**

**Solution**\
Points of You® developed a two-part workshop that leveraged the
collective energy of all 160 participants, focusing on reflection,
connection, and future visioning.

**Process**

1.  **Designing a Large-Scale, Unified Experience**\
    To maximize the power of the group, the workshop was designed to
    engage all participants simultaneously, rather than splitting them
    into smaller groups.

2.  **Workshop Structure**

    -   **Part 1: Reflection with The Coaching Game**\
        Participants began by reflecting on the past year using **The
        Coaching Game**. They worked in pairs, rotating partners
        throughout the session.\
        Each pair explored key questions designed to surface insights
        about their achievements, challenges, and learnings.\
        This format encouraged cross-departmental interaction and
        fostered new connections.

    -   **Part 2: Vision Setting with Clicket**\
        In the second half of the workshop, participants used
        **Clicket**, an innovative Points of You® tool, to create
        personal vision boards.\
        These boards reflected their aspirations for the upcoming year,
        both professionally and personally.

3.  **Creating an Inspiring Environment**\
    The Points of You® team meticulously prepared the venue to enhance
    the experience:

    -   **Creative Setup**: Tables were adorned with Clicket kits, photo
        cards, and colorful materials.

    -   **Ambiance**: A curated playlist played in the background,
        energizing the room and inspiring creativity.

4.  **Sharing and Integration**\
    Once participants completed their vision boards, they gathered in
    small groups to share their creations. This provided an opportunity
    to articulate their goals and receive support and encouragement from
    their peers.

**C. Results**

**Outcomes**

1.  **Enhanced Connection and Collaboration**\
    Employees reported forming new connections and gaining a deeper
    understanding of colleagues from different departments.

2.  **Unleashed Creativity**\
    Participants, even those from highly analytical roles, embraced the
    creative process, finding it both refreshing and impactful.

3.  **Emotional Engagement**\
    Many participants shared that the experience was deeply moving. Even
    those known for being reserved or skeptical opened up, leading to
    heartfelt discussions and personal breakthroughs.

4.  **Clear Vision for the Future**\
    The vision boards served as a tangible representation of
    participants' aspirations, helping them align their personal goals
    with the company's mission.

**Participant Feedback**\
*\"This workshop was a game-changer. I connected with colleagues in ways
I never thought possible, and the vision board exercise gave me clarity
and motivation for the year ahead.\"*

**Additional Insight**\
Following the workshop, the company's **Head of Innovation** expressed
interest in a dedicated session for her team.\
She highlighted how the experience revealed untapped potential within
her colleagues and recognized the value of applying Points of You® tools
in smaller, more focused team settings.

**D. Conclusion**

**Impact**\
The workshop successfully achieved its goals, fostering deeper
connections and equipping participants with a clear vision for the
future.

**Next Steps**\
Building on the workshop's success, the company plans to:

-   **Incorporate Points of You® tools** into other initiatives, such as
    team-building events and strategy sessions.

-   **Host smaller, targeted workshops** for specific teams, starting
    with the Digital Innovation Team.

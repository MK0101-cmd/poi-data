# Welcome to Faces!	So... let's face it

Hi! Honestly? We’re excited.

Every time a new game is born, it comes with a shudder inside, sleepless nights, and mostly with a sense of hovering in the heights without touching the ground. Yes, as if wings are being formed. So welcome to Faces...

About four years ago, we (Efrat and Yaron) drove out to the desert for a private retreat of our own. It was in the middle of winter - at that time of year when the desert turns from being monochromatic to being colorful... Lots of green... and very stormy. Right there, in the space between the silence and the storm, the idea of Faces first came up. We wanted to create a new game, to do something truly innovative, and to make it as good and of the same language as The Coaching Game and Punctum.

Since then we have gone through quite a journey. Kind of like the stormy desert, our journey included a lot of “back and forth” moments, many focus groups from all over the world, and some emotional rollercoasters.

During this journey, Faces slowly started forming, and turned into a game that is all about people and relationships. We found out that through the observation of others, we dare to look at ourselves in the most direct manner, and that is what Faces provides - a straight look into our own eyes.

Enjoy the journey. With an open heart, a direct look and true love Efrat & Yaron

From the moment we are born, our faces are who we are - our age and our sex are imprinted on them and we are recognizable through them. Our feelings, thoughts, dreams, intentions...

They’re all there. In the age of Facebook and Selfies, we are always busy observing images of people’s faces.

While observing the faces of others, whether it’s in the real world or in the digital one, we analyze this silent form of

communication, and within seconds we can tell the person’s sex, expression, mood, thoughts and emotions.

Faces is about human beings - the way people look at people. How we look at others and how others look at us.

The work with Faces brings us together with meaningful figures in our lives. Family, friends, partners to the journey, characters who have inspired us and those who hurt us.

Faces raises questions regarding the relationships in our lives, about the roles we play in them and about the ways in which we reflect in them. The variety of points of view offered by the cards are like mirrors - we look at them and see in them something inside ourselves.

# Get to know Faces

Inside the plaid fabric set, the following articles await:

## Photo cards

In the heart of the game, are Photo cards with pictures of the faces of 99 characters, captured in special moments. The images create a connection with the viewer and give way to

rising thoughts. The images are all in Black & White, in order to diminish distractions and focus the observation on the face itself.

## Reflection cards

The Reflection cards represent a variety of human characteristics we all share. The Reflections are divided into 7 series - each marked by its own symbol on the cards. Next to them, there are page numbers which correspond to pages in the included book

- where more points of view on each one of the Reflection cards are available.

Real mirror

## Blank Reflection cards

8 of the Reflection cards are blank cards. This enables incorporating writing into the process, and adding more Reflection cards of your own to your game experience.

## Real mirror card

A unique card which leaves no other option than looking at ourselves in the most authentic way possible. The mirror card transforms our own face into a meaningful observation card.

## Process maps

The map included in Faces offers 4 observational processes for personal and 1:1 work.

## Inspirational book

The book is a compilation of stories, song lyrics, poems and quotes - all offering additional points of view on each one of the 58 Reflection cards.

# About the Series

The Reflection cards are divided into seven series which offer additional dimensions to the understanding of each card. It is important to say that a reflection is not an archetype and does not represent a whole character - we see it as a fragment of a personality.

## The Open-minded Series - The places where we are open for opportunities.

These are the creative and curious parts of us. These are the parts that know how to let go, dream, feel comfortable even when out of the comfort zone, get emotional, believe that everything is going to be okay even if the next step is not entirely clear.

The Givers Series - The places where we open our hearts. These are the warm and sensitive parts in us, which notice others and give way easily in order to help out. The ability

to differentiate, take in, give precise care with generosity, be completely devoted and with a whole heart.

## The Takers Series - The places where we are mean to ourselves and to others.

After meeting our “taker” parts, there is less. Less energy, less confidence, less joy, less peacefulness... These are the parts which awaken feelings of shame, insecurity, doubt and fear.

The Stormy Series - The places where we let ourselves go wild. These are the parts in us where fire burns; where there is no other way than to feel intensely. Our stormy parts will not be satisfied going halfway. These parts are loyal to the inner truth and to the power pushing us from the inside.

## The Calculated Series - The places where we are accurate with ourselves.

These are the parts which love order and logic. From them comes the ability to be analytical, cool and stable even under pressure; to keep morals and ethics, to take responsibility. Sometimes with difficulty, to color outside the lines. The mission is above all.

## The Lost Series - The places where we lose our way.

These are the stuck parts. Those dark places we have no idea how to get out of. These are the moments in which we feel small.

These are vulnerable, victim-like, voiceless parts which cause us to lose faith quickly and give up - mainly on ourselves.

The Knowing Series - The places where we know deep inside. The parts of us that just know. Connected, independent, on their path. These parts make us turn into leaders. The places that are open to dealing with the quest itself and the journey - less about others, more about me.

Mommy, the moon is a stone of some sort? Yes, and it's big and it's white

But it is far away and that's why it's as small as a kite Mommy, the babies all come from the tummy?

Of course

And you'll have one? Perhaps

I don't have a big tummy You don't

You are young so you can't

And the baby inside is like a cocoon?

It's hard to explain, when you'll grow up you'll understand.

And only myself and the answers in me Are aware of the secret we know

That when you grow up You don't understand But one day

You just let the questions go.

# Creative

Open-minded Series

/ INSPIRING / AR TIST / COLORFUL / INNO V A T OR /

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

“Think different” An advertising slogan for Apple, Inc. 1997

Creativity requires the courage to let go of certainties.

# Free Spirit

Open-minded Series

/ NONCONFORMIST / SPONT ANEOUS / W ANDERER / FLO WING /

Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremor ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”

J.M. Barrie - Peter Pan

I like to be a free spirit. Some don’t like that, but that’s the way I am.

/ THEORIZER / D A YDREAMER / ROMANTIC /

The great Taoist master Chuang Tzu once dreamt that he was a butterfly fluttering here and there. In the dream he had no awareness of his individuality as a person. He was only a butterfly. Suddenly, he awoke and found himself laying there, a person once again. But then he thought to himself, “Was I

before a man who dreamt about being a butterfly, or am I now a butterfly who dreams about being a man?”

Zen Story

For me, dreaming is simply being pragmatic.

Shimon Peres

When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it happened or not.

Mark Twain

The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease forever to be able to do it.

/ COMPROMISING / GENTLE / A CCEPTING / AD APT ABLE /

An old man slipped on a wet rock near the edge of a river and fell in. As onlookers watched in horror, he was swept towards a high waterfall.

There was great joy when he emerged bruised but otherwise unharmed downstream. “How did you manage to survive?” asked one man in the crowd that gathered around.

Said the old man, “Instead of trying to make the water accommodate me, I accommodated myself to it. Instead of fighting it, I relaxed into the swirl and allowed it to shape me. I worked with the force of the water instead of against it. That is how I survived.”

Zen story

All know that the drop merges into the ocean,

# Intuitive

Open-minded Series

/ CONNECTED / INNER V OICE / MA GIC AL /

In his book, Kahneman describes the human thinking as a collaboration between two completely different technologies. Kahneman calls the first type of technology "System 1". This system operates "back stage", unaware, automatic, and the usage of it does not require any effort and is usually not created out of conscious choice. System 1 is also exclusively in charge of what we call intuition. It is, in fact, intuition.

Kahneman calls the second system "System 2". This system is the stream of conscious thinking. It is very slow and can only do one thing at a time – and even this requires some effort and control. The two systems operate in completely different manners from one another. In System 1, many associative ideas can pop up parallelly, and can go through processing and send a concrete "bottom line" to System 2. In System 2 the conclusion will enter a line of linear thoughts and ideas that follow each other in a straight line, in a rhythm not much faster than the rhythm of speaking. If the mind was a show, says Kahneman, System 2 would have been the vain side character, mistakenly thinking it is the main lead.

Oren Huberman - Calcalist, about Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry - The Little Prince

Intuition is seeing with the soul.

Dean Koontz

When you believe, signs turn up everywhere.

Lyn Ragan - Signs from the Afterlife

When I get logical, and I don't trust my instincts - that's when I get in trouble.

Angelina Jolie

My approach to acting is that I am totally intuitive.

I read the script and I get it. If I don't get it, I can't do it.

Morgan Freeman

Most intuitive ideas have to be clarified, so there is a trial and error process.

Krishnamurti tells the story of how the devil and a friend of his were walking down the street, when they saw ahead of them a man stoop down and pick up something from the ground, look at it, and put it away in his pocket. The friend said to the devil, “What did that man pick up?” “He picked up a piece of Truth,” said the devil. “That is a very bad business for you, then,” said his friend. “Oh, not at all,” the devil replied, “I am going to convince him to create a method out of his findings.”

Ilan Amit - The Mystery of Presence

The fish trap exists because of the fish. Once you've gotten the fish you can forget the trap. The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit. Once you've gotten the rabbit, you can forget the snare. Words exist because of meaning. Once you've gotten the meaning, you can forget the words. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?

Chuang Tzu

We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers.

Carl Sagan

The simplest questions are also the deepest. Where were you born? Where is your home? Where are you facing? What do you do? Think about each of these every once in a while and see how your answers vary.

Richard Bach

There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.

# Authentic

Open-minded Series

/ GENUINE / SINCERE / HONEST / PURE /

I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile

at those who do not want to smile at me. I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. I decided not to coexist anymore with pretense, hypocrisy, dishonesty and cheap praise. I do not tolerate selective erudition nor academic arrogance. I do not adjust either to popular gossiping. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that’s why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment

or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience.

Originally written by José Micard Teixeira, quoted by Meryl Streep

Anyhow, the older I get, the less impressed I become with originality. These days, I’m far more moved by authenticity… If it’s authentic enough, believe me – it will feel original.

Elizabeth Gilbert - Big Magic

O, to be sure, we laugh less and play less and wear uncomfortable disguises like adults, but beneath the costume is the child we always are, whose needs are simple, whose daily life is still best described by fairy tales.

Leo Rosten

The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.

C.G. Jung

But above all, in order to be, never try to seem.

Albert Camus - Notebooks, 1935-1951

This woman needs no introduction. Her books have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide. But there was a time in her life when she was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide. Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child. She signed up for government

aid (she was so poor, she could not afford to support herself and her daughter), describing her economic status as being “poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.” In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry “came fully formed” into her mind. In 1995, she finished the manuscript of her first book on an old manual typewriter. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript. Editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury advised her to get a day job since she had little chance of making money from writing children’s books.

Today, she is United Kingdom’s best-selling living author, with an estimated fortune of £560 million, ranking her as the twelfth richest woman in the UK. She is none other than J.K Rowling – the creator of the Harry Potter series.

A woman was waiting at an airport one night. She hunted for a book in the airport shops, bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop. She was engrossed in her book but happened to see, that the man sitting beside her, as bold as could be… grabbed a cookie or two from the bag in between, which she tried to ignore to avoid

a scene. She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by, thinking, “If I wasn’t so nice, I would blacken his eye.” With each cookie she took, he took one too, when only one was left, she wondered what he would do. With a smile on his face, he took the last cookie and broke it in half. He offered her half, as he ate the other, she snatched it from him and thought… oooh, brother. This guy has some nerve and he’s also rude, why he didn’t even show any gratitude! She had never known when she had been so galled, and sighed with relief when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate. She boarded the plane, and sank in her seat, then she sought her book, which was almost complete. As she reached in her baggage, she gasped with surprise, there was her bag of cookies, in front of her eyes. If mine are here, she moaned in despair, the others were his, and he tried to share. Too late to apologize, she realized with grief, that she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief.

Spiritual leader, humanitarian and visionary Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, known throughout the world simply as “Amma,” has served the world-community for decades, imparting wisdom, strength and inspiration. Through her extraordinary acts of love, inner strength and self-sacrifice, Amma has endeared herself to millions and inspired thousands to follow in her path of selfless service.

Mata Amritanandamayi concludes her programs by embracing each person attending the event. Far from a brief book-signing or walk along the rope line, these personal, one-on-one meetings take up the vast majority of Amma’s time. Amma has given this motherly embrace, known as her darshan, to more than 38 million people throughout the world. She has been known to give darshan for more than 22 hours without interruption.

In 1851, German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer formulated what has been termed the “hedgehog’s dilemma,” a parable about human relationships and intimacy. The parable goes something like this: when it is cold outside, hedgehogs move towards one another in order to be warmed by each other’s body heat. However, upon reaching a certain closeness to one another they are pricked by each other’s prickly spines, causing them to retreat to a safer distance. The hedgehogs must find the proper distance from one another to remain warm and not get hurt.

In a gentle way, you can shake the world.

Gurdjeiff, and other great spiritual teachers, like Krisnamurti, are those “messengers from above,” that based on their feelings came to the world to fix it, and specifically in the generations where corruption feasts. None of these messengers succeeded in bringing their intended correction, and it cannot be any other way. Because no one can bring the correction to others, and the attempt of the teacher to fix only distances the people from their own ability to fix themselves.

Krishnamurti once said that 700 years shall go by before another man like himself shows up. But he also said that there are no real spiritual teachers and gurus, because all spiritual teachers only strengthen the separateness and conflict and the corruption in the world, and that eventually every man needs to be his own light.

I am a doctor working at a little clinic. One day an old man in his 80's walked into my clinic.

He told me he was in a rush, as he had a very important engagement at 9 AM he couldn't miss. I decided to treat him since the doctor in charge was busy.

While I was gently pulling out his stitches, I asked him where he was off to that was more important than this treatment.

“I am going to have breakfast with my wife, who is in the hospital.” “Why was she hospitalized, if I may ask?”

“She's been there for a few years now,” he answered. “she has Alzheimer's and needs constant care.”

I asked the man if his wife would be worried if he were late to their breakfast.

“No,” he said quietly, “She hasn't recognized me in over five years.” “And you go to her every morning although she doesn't know who you are?”

The man smiled and said: “She may not know who I am, but I know who she is, and I remember for both of us.” And he shook my hand, thanked me and left me standing there, my body shaking with sudden emotion.

A traveler walking alone saw a monk working in a field, so he stopped and asked him: “I’m on my way to the village in the valley, can you tell me what it’s like?” “Where have you come from?” enquired the monk. “I have come from the village in the mountains. It was terrible!” the man exclaimed, “no-one spoke my language, I had to sleep on a dirt floor, they fed me disgusting stew and the weather was atrocious.” “Then I think that you will find that the village in the valley is much the same,” the monk noted. A few hours later another traveler passed by and he said to the monk, “I am on my way to the village in the valley, can you tell what it’s like?” “Where have you come from?” enquired the monk. “I have come from the village in the mountains - it was awesome!” the man replied, “No-one spoke my language so we had to communicate using our hands! I had to sleep on the dirt floor - I’ve never done that before! They fed me some sort of weird stew and it was so cool to experience how the locals lived! The weather was freezing cold, which meant that I really got a taste of the local conditions. It was one of the best experiences of my life.” “Then I think that you’ll find that the village in the valley is much the same,” responded the monk.

# Humble

Givers Series

/ MODEST / UN ASSUMING / Q UIET /

These are the few ways we can practice humility: To speak as little as possible of one’s self.

To mind one’s own business.

Not to want to manage other people’s affairs. To avoid curiosity.

To accept contradictions and correction cheerfully. To pass over the mistakes of others.

To accept insults and injuries.

To accept being slighted, forgotten and disliked. To be kind and gentle even under provocation. Never to stand on one’s dignity.

To choose always the hardest.

Blessed are they who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing.

/ N ARCISSIST / UTILIT ARIAN / EGOIST /

I think, therefore I am is the statement of an intellectual who underrates toothaches. I feel, therefore I am is a truth much more universally valid, and it applies to everything that’s alive. My self does not differ substantially from yours in terms of its thought.

Many people, few ideas: we all think more or less the same, and we exchange, borrow, steal thoughts from one another. However, when someone steps on my foot, only I feel the pain. The

basis of the self is not thought but suffering, which is the most fundamental of all feelings. While it suffers, not even a cat can doubt its unique and uninterchangeable self. In intense suffering the world disappears and each of us is alone with himself.

Suffering is the university of egocentrism.

A minister came back from a trip abroad with a very expensive roll of fabric. The minister invited a tailor over to his mansion. “I am expecting something very special.” He said.

While the tailor was working, he envisioned all the praise he would be receiving for the minister’s new and unique suit. But, after trying on the suit, the minister turned red with anger. The embarrassed tailor returned home depressed. And that very same day the tailor drove over to his Rabbi. The Rabbi said: “Go back to your home, unravel the suit until it is just fabric once more, and stitch it up again right away. Take the new suit back to the minister and ask him to try it on again.”

The tailor returned to his home, unraveled it, and stitched it back together, and with his new craftwork returned to the mansion again. To his surprise, the minister was thrilled. The tailor did not understand what had happened – it was the exact same suit! “When you first stitched up the minister’s suit you did it with vanity and with thoughts about your own dignity. But pride has no charm, and neither did the suit. I was certain that if you tried to stitch it up again, this time in a humbler manner, it will be loved by everyone. And so, it was!” Smiled the Rabbi.

It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. The water ran down from her hair and clothes... And yet she said that she was a real princess.

“Well, we’ll soon find that out,” thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bedroom, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider- down beds on top of the mattresses.

On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning, she was asked how she had slept.

“Oh, very badly!” said she. “I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It’s horrible!” Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea.

In the city of Chelm it was extremely cold in the winter and a lot of mud accumulated in the streets. Anyone who stepped outside got covered in mud, even the king – so no one recognized him. The senior city council decided to buy the king golden shoes.

The men assumed that if people see a man with golden shoes, they will show him respect.

The king wore the golden shoes and went outside. The shoes got covered in mud, and no one treated the king with respect. The city council decided to buy the king overshoes to protect the golden shoes. The king wore the golden shoes, covered them with the overshoes and went outside. The overshoes got covered in mud and no one treated the king with respect.

The city council decided to pierce holes in the overshoes, so the gold will show.

The king went outside again, the mud got in through the holes and covered up the gold.

The city council met up again and decided to fill the holes with straw.

“The Show Must Go On” is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May. The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life; he was dying from complications due to HIV/AIDS, although his illness had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill. Mercury was so ill when the band recorded the song in 1990 that May

had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury’s performance, May states; “I said, ‘Fred, I don’t know if this is going to be possible to sing.’ And he went, ‘I’ll fucking do it, darling’ – vodka down – and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.”My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies / Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die / I can fly, my friends / The show must go on / The show must go on / I’ll face it with a grin / I’m never giving in / On, with the show.

Freedom, that terrible word inscribed on the chariot of the storm, is the motivating principle of all revolutions. Without it, justice seems inconceivable to the rebel’s mind. There comes a time, however, when justice demands the suspension of freedom.

Then terror, on a grand or small scale, makes its appearance to consummate the revolution. Every act of rebellion expresses

a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being. But one day nostalgia takes up arms and assumes the responsibility of total guilt; in other words, adopts murder and violence.

To be a warrior a man has to be, first of all, and rightfully so, keenly aware of his own death. But to be concerned with death would force any one of us to focus on the self and that would be debilitating. So the next thing one needs to be a warrior is

detachment. The idea of imminent death, instead of becoming an obsession, becomes an indifference.

Now you must detach yourself; detach yourself from everything. Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he is incapable of abandoning himself to anything. Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he can’t deny

himself anything. A man of that sort, however, does not crave, for he has acquired a silent lust for life and for all things of life. He knows his death is stalking him and won’t give him time to cling to anything, so he tries, without craving, all of everything.

There are other people whose skin is soft and clear and healthy but something about Sensuality’s skin announces that she is alive. When the sun bursts forth in May, Sensuality likes to take off her shirt and feel the sweet warmth of the sun’s rays brush across her shoulder. This is not intended as a provocative

gesture but other people are, as usual, upset. Sensuality does not understand why everyone else is so disturbed by her. As a young girl, she was often scolded for going barefoot.

Sensuality likes to make love at the border where time and space change places. When she is considering a potential lover, she takes him to the ocean and watches. Does he dance with the waves? Does he tell her about the time he slept on the beach when he was seventeen and woke up in the middle of the night to look at the moon? Does he laugh and cry and notice how big the sky is?

It is spring now, and Sensuality is very much in love these days. Her new friend is very sweet. Climbing into bed the first time, he confessed he was a little intimidated about making love with her. Sensuality just laughed and said, ‘But we’ve been making love for days.”

ORLAN is a performance artist who uses her own body and the procedures of plastic surgery to make “carnal art”. Her name is written all letters in majuscule because ORLAN doesn’t want to fit into the lines or the ranks. She is transforming her face, but her aim is not to attain a commonly held standard of beauty. ORLAN is the only artist working so radically with her own body, asking questions about the status of the body in society.

In 1990, on her 43rd birthday, she had the first of the operation- performances that completely altered her face. There were nine total surgeries from 1990 to 1993, and they were part of her project The Reincarnation of Saint-Orlan. All of the surgeries were carefully thought of, captured in video, and broadcasted in various institutions around the world, for example, the Sandra Gehring Gallery in New York and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The Reincarnation of Saint-Orlan began when she created a composite image, via morphing computer software, of her own face, combined Mona Lisa, Diana, Europa, Botticelli’s Venus, and François Pascal Simon Gérard’s Psyche.

Alexander was shocked by the weight of the eye glaring at him. It even seemed to him as if the glare of the eye had a spark of victory in it, knowing it cannot be won over by his gold. An old man who was present stepped slowly towards the eye and poured a few grains of sand into the open eye, which shut – and suddenly, the scale shot up tumultuously.

Next to love, balance is the most important thing.

John Wooden

Activity and rest are two vital aspects of life. To find a balance in them is a skill in itself. Wisdom is knowing when to have rest, when to have activity, and how much of each to have. Finding them in each other - activity in rest and rest in activity - is the ultimate freedom.

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

In 1986, a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test destroyed Unit 4 of Chernobyl’s nuclear power plant, spewing massive amounts of deadly radioactive material into the environment. The death toll was unknown and rumored to be anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand.

While many perished, three clean-up volunteers – Alexi Ananenko, Valeri Bezpoalov and Boris Baronov – willingly met their fate.

During the well-documented disaster, a pool of water used for emergencies in case of a break in the cooling pumps or steam pipes became flooded with a highly radioactive liquid that was in danger of blowing up. These three men suited up in scuba gear and swam into the radioactive waters of the flooded chamber, knowing full well they would die as a result. They opened up a gate valve, which allowed the contaminated water to drain out. Days after reaching the surface all three men succumbed to radiation poisoning and were buried in lead coffins. If not for the bravery of the “Chernobyl Suicide Squad” a thermal explosion would have taken place resulting in unfathomable disaster.

“I never did anything worth doing entirely by accident… Almost none of my inventions were derived in that manner. They were achieved by having trained myself to be analytical and to endure and tolerate hard work.”

Thomas Edison wasn’t about working smarter, just working harder. And that doesn’t come as much of a surprise to us today, given that one of Edison’s most famous quotes is “Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.”

But most people don’t realize that that’s only half the quote. There’s more to the quote than just the most frequently repeated bits. Here’s the whole Edison quote:

“Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Accordingly, a ‘genius’ is often merely a talented person who has done all of his or her homework.”

Imagine a group of people living in a cave underneath the ground. They are sitting with their backs facing the opening of the cave, and their limbs are tied in such a way as to prevent them from seeing anything but the inside wall of the cave.

Behind them a fire is burning, and in its light, strange figures passing by cast different shapes on the wall of the cave. Since they have been sitting this way from the moment they were born, they believe that these shadows are all that exists.

Imagine now that one of the cave’s residents manages somehow to free himself from his ties. After his eyes will adjust to the

light he will start seeing how beautiful things are. And then he will see the sun in the sky, and will understand that it brings life to flowers and animals, just as the light of the fire created the shadows.

The lucky cave resident can now keep celebrating the freedom upon which he stumbled. He tries to convince his friends that the shadows are only blinking shadows of “actual” things. But they don’t believe him. Eventually they kill him.

It happens that a man is born into a foreign country. That although he has a father and a mother, brothers and sisters, language and culture – he is really from a different place, and he does not know it. He suffers all his life, until he understands, and begins his journey back to his country of origin, where

no one has ever been and no one can promise him whether it really exists. This sort of man is born into hell, and at first does not know he is in hell. He goes on living his life and stumbling repeatedly, and only after a long time something happens: a moment of grace, where he earns a glimpse of a vision, just for a moment, of his own place. A snippet of a postcard from his place. Or someone from there passes by him, smiling – a moment which changes his life, because once and for all he

understands that this place exists. That he is not dreaming. That there are lives better than his current life. And of course, in that moment he also understands that he is living in hell.

When the outraged parents confronted Hakuin with their daughter’s accusation, he simply replied “Is that so?”

When the child was born, the parents brought it to the Hakuin, who now was viewed as a pariah by the whole village. They demanded that he take care of the child since it was his responsibility. “Is that so?” Hakuin said calmly as he accepted the child.

For many months he took very good care of the child until the daughter could no longer withstand the lie she had told. She confessed that the real father was a young man in the village whom she had tried to protect. The parents immediately went to Hakuin to see if he would return the baby. With profuse apologies they explained what had happened. “Is that so?” Hakuin said as he handed them the child.

Meadow Soprano: Fine. Tony Soprano: Alright look, Mead, you’re a grown woman, almost. Some of my money comes from illegal gambling and whatnot. How does that make you feel?

Meadow Soprano: At least you don’t keep denying it, like Mom. Kids in school think it’s actually kinda neat.

Mulan was washing clothes when she heard that the army was recruiting new soldiers. She knew that her father was too old and too ill to survive the war, so she decided to disguise herself as a man to go in his place. The tale continues with Mulan leaving

for the battlefield carrying the sword inherited from the ancestors of the family. She fought for ten or twelve years and gained

high merit, but refused any reward and retired to her hometown instead. During the war, she met an officer, who is normally named Jin Yong, with whom she fell in love. Legends say that after 10 years on the battlefield Mulan was promoted to general. When Jin Yong learned that Mulan was a woman, he became more attached to her. In many versions of the story both Mulan and Jin Yong dream about getting married to each other. One day, before a very difficult battle, Mulan decided to go onto the battlefield in women’s clothing so her soldiers would realize her true identity. The reaction of the soldiers was one full of respect and admiration. They were overwhelmed by her bravery, grace, and wisdom. After another heroic triumph, the emperor wanted to reward Mulan. He was surprised that the bravest of his soldiers was a female. However, Mulan asked for nothing but a horse to ride home.

And I realized that some things just don’t work that way. Life isn’t a fairytale. And the person you fall in love with doesn’t always love you back. But that’s ok, because at the very least it makes you stronger. And brings you to a place where you can fall in love with yourself. And that to me is more important than finding someone that only makes you complete when they are around. It’s really about finding the person that will teach you all the lessons you need to know... so that you feel complete all by yourself.

You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She’s not perfect—you aren’t either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She

may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don’t hurt her, don’t change her, don’t analyze and don’t expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she’s not there.

True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing.

# Working with Faces	First Encounter

Introduction

First Encounter

Working 1:1

Group activity

To those of you who are already familiar with us - Faces is based on the exact same working method as the one used in The Coaching Game and in Punctum. Photo cards, word cards, an inspirational book and process maps. However, the work with Faces is entirely different than with the two other games – which are based on the elements of Phototherapy and metaphors.

Faces is obviously a Phototherapeutic tool as well, but the observation of images of faces, of facial features, of expressions, leaves us staring directly, with no mediators or metaphors. We are observing something external, but the processing of it is emotional. With Faces we can look deeply into ourselves, into our meaningful relationships and into people in general. We can observe our family trees, define ideal partners we would like to invite into our lives, use the tool as an asset in recruiting new employees, or observe our way of leading and managing. This

is just a small taste. You are welcome to join our workshops and deepen your understanding of the tool and its many possibilities. Faces is a deep, surprising and fascinating journey inwards.

## Enjoy the journey…

You can work in many ways with Faces. For your first encounter with the game, we offer a short process: Card of the day.

Lay the Photo cards and the Reflection cards in front of you - facing up. When you go over all of them carefully, ask yourself: How am I feeling today? Choose one Photo card and one Reflection card which best depict your current mood.

## Observe the Photo card:

Why did you choose this face? What does this face express? What kind of character is he/she? What would you like to say to the character in front of you? What is it trying to tell you? What do you feel when you look at it? Who does this character remind you of? Does it look like anyone you know?

## Observe the Reflection card:

Which emotions, feelings, memories does it bring out of me? How does the word connect to the image I chose?

## Deepening the Inspiration

Open the book on the page number mentioned on the Reflection card. Read the various types of content and try to answer the original questions using new points of view.

] 130 [	] 131 [

# Working 1:1

The process map is designed for personal work or for 1:1 work. The map enables connecting several cards to guiding questions which lead a thought process.

The map is double sided and you can twist it and turn it around in order to go from process to process:

Side A:

## “The Child In Me”

“What makes me who I am?”

2 Maps to examine one character.

Side B:

## “Back to reality” “Nobody’s Perfect”

2 Maps to examine relationships with significant others.

Choose the map which suits your interest best. Read the questions and focus on the relevant character or relationship.

Choose 3 Photo cards and 3 Reflection cards (facing up/down

- your choice.) Place the cards in the marked spots on the map.

Go over each question separately and observe the cards you chose. What does each card express? How do the cards connect to each other? How do the cards answer the question?

Open the book at the page numbers that are written on your chosen Reflection cards. During the process of going over the information in the book, try to look at the question from different points of view.

At the end of the process, take the mirror card in your hands, look into your own eyes and ask yourself - what is the most meaningful insight I am taking with me from this process?

* There are two ways of working with the cards: when they are faced down - hidden cards, or when they are faced up - exposed cards. Both ways create interesting dynamics, and eventually achieve the same goals. Working with exposed cards enables a fascinating process of choosing, while working with hidden cards enables letting go and adds an element of surprise.

# Group activity

## “My Facebook profile picture”

About the process

A group observational process, which deals with the differences in the way we see ourselves versus the way other people see us. A deep process which starts out lightly and gradually turns from being cognitive to being emotional.

## Number of participants

8-20 participants (if larger, we recommend dividing into smaller groups)

## Time frame

120 minutes (for a group of up to 20 participants)

## What do you need?

1 set of Faces

A notebook and something to write with for each participant Sticky notes (about 25 for each participant)

## Preparation

Before the workshop, make sure to organize the Faces Photo cards facing up in the middle of the room.

## Introduction

Say to the participants: Today we will work with Faces, a new game by Points of You. A direct and powerful way to get to know ourselves through the observation of others.

## Choosing a Photo card

After introducing the process, invite the participants to “change” their profile pictures on Facebook - and choose the photo which expresses them best according to this moment. Tell them to try to make their choice as intuitive as possible - to just choose an image that they like (3 minutes to choose.) After everyone chose cards, pick up the ones that were not chosen.

## Writing a profile

Ask everyone to look at the image as if it were a mirror, then ask: Who’s in the image? What are their names? Where are they from? Where do they live? In the village? In the city? How many children do they have, if any? What do they do? What do they love? Who do they love? What was the last thing they posted on their wall? What books do they read?

You then invite the participants to each write his/her own Facebook Profile for the person on the card. (10 minutes) During the time given for writing, you may continue guiding the participants with questions.

] 134 [	] 135 [

## Gathering in a circle

Ask the participants to take with them their profile pictures and to organize the chairs in a tight circle and have the back of them facing the center of the room. Hand each participant a stack of sticky memo notes.

## A round of points of view

Explain to the participants: I will soon ask each of you to pass your card to the participant sitting to your right. The card will be in the hands of the new participant for 3 minutes before again passing right, until it is back where it started. During the 3 minutes in which you will be holding the card, you will have to do three things:

First minute: Just observe. Second minute: Write in your notebook intuitively. Third minute: Choose a word or a sentence to be a title to the image, and write it down on one of the sticky memo notes. Then stick it to the back of the card. When the time is up, pass the card to the right, with the notes that are on it. You then start the activity. Make sure to measure time and give out clear directions. You should soothe the observational stage with guiding questions: What was your first reaction

when you received this image? What does this face express? Which character do you see? What would you like to say to the

character in front of you? What is it trying to tell you? What do you feel when you look at it?What do you like or dislike about it? What is this character hiding? Do you trust it? Could you be friends? If you allow yourself to be judgmental - what would you say about it? Who does it look like? Who does it remind you of?

## Sharing

The round ends when each participant receives his/her own profile picture once again. Once this happens, everyone can go back to sitting in their original spots. You then ask the participants to each open up a 2-page spread in their notebooks and stick inside all the memo notes, then proceed to read his/her initial Facebook profile, the intuitive writing and the “titles” gathered for them on the notes. You then start the sharing part of the process. You tell the participants that they may share about anything they experienced during the process. During the sharing part, you may ask: Which memo note was your favorite? Which didn’t you like? How well does your profile reflect who you are?

## Closing

In this last round of sharing, you ask them to share what he/she is taking away from the workshop. Before you part, ask the participants to write the character a letter.

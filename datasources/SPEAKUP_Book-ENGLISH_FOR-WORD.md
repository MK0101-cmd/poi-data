#### Workflow

Based on the Dialogue Starters Guide, here is a more detailed flow of how to prepare and conduct your next meeting using our Dialogue Starters. The following example is for a one-on- one session:

Choose the appropriate Dialogue Starter connecting to your needs. Consider printing it for note-taking.

Connect the employees to the objectives of the meeting and introduce them to our way of working using photos and metaphors.

Spread the Photo cards face up and allow the participant to select the cards that connect to the topic of the meeting and the questions asked.

Guide the participant in observing their photo, see page 12 for more guidance.

Invite the participant to share about their photo and how it is connected to the topic of the meeting and to the first question of the Dialogue Starter.

This is the time to ask your questions to what you heard, to engage in a dialogue. Be curious, check are you understanding correctly. Once you feel you explored enough move to the next question and repeat.

Once all the questions have been answered, invite the participant to choose one Word card as a summary of the process so far.

Invite the participant to write down their main insights from the process and create a action plan to apply those insights practically.

Encourage the participant to take a photo of the session as a reference for future reflection, the cards can continue to inspire.

Finish the process by asking the participant to share in 2-3 sentences their main takeaways together with their planed action items.

When working with a larger group or doing a self-coaching process, follow the same steps just adapting them to your process setting.

# Working Free Style

In the previous section, we equipped you with ideas on how to use our Dialogue Starters. That's just the tip of the iceberg!

Speak Up can be your ultimate conversation companion in many different ways.

From quick introductions to whole day programs, use the whole toolkit or just some element. Here are some key points to bear in mind as you embark on your journey of empowered conversations:

Flexibility: You have the freedom to choose questions randomly or based on your specific needs. Additionally, you can utilize Blank cards to create customized processes.

Customization: You can decide to work with all elements of the tool or select only certain parts that suit your requirements.

Simplicity: Remember that less is more. Often, a single question is sufficient to yield deep results.

Emphasis on Sharing: The sharing aspect is crucial as we strive to foster a culture of dialogue. Focus on listening attentively and creating an environment where participants feel comfortable opening up (no expectations, no judgment).

Rule of the Deck: Throughout the process, always allow participants the option to change their chosen card.

Experiment: Try out different ways of using it. There is no right way!

Trust the Process: Even if things don't always work out exactly as you planned, there will be some insights to be gained. Don't worry about making mistakes.

Try out the following activities in your next meetings:

#### First Encounters

A very simple icebreaker, your participants choose 1 Photo card that represents them, and they can introduce themselves through this card.

#### Mood Barometer

Use this activity to gauge the team's feelings. Draw a line on a game board, write 1 at one end and 10 at the other. Invite each participant to choose one Photo card that represents how they are feeling, to share why they chose this card and to place one of the stickers on the scale marking their energy level (10 for highest energy, 1 for lowest).

#### What Question am I ending with?

End your meeting with this activity. Spread the Question cards for everyone to see.

Each participant selects one question that they are ending with. They can either share why this question is resonating with them, or they can have an assignment to answer it before the next meeting.

# Mindset & Setting

Your mindset & setting can significantly influence on the dialogue outcomes. Take a moment to reflect on your approach and the environment you wish to cultivate before engaging in each conversation and meeting you have. Depending on the specific employees within

the organization, their department, and their stage in the employee journey, they will require a different setting. By preparing with intentionality, you can foster productive and transformative experiences that have a positive impact on the teams you collaborate with.

#### Mindset:

When preparing for a meeting or discussion, it's important to consider your mindset and the purpose of the meeting. What do you hope to gain from this interaction? Take time beforehand to set your objectives and consider the expected outcomes. At the start of the meeting, share your objectives with the other participants. This will help set clear expectations and keep everyone aligned throughout the discussion.

Secondly, to build an open dialogue, we need to create a space where team members feel comfortable expressing their true voice. The power of Speak Up lies in its ability to invite different perspectives through the use of photographs, questions, words, and metaphors. It's important to teach participants that they can speak up and be heard. By actively listening and asking the right questions, we can create a mindset of open dialogue.

#### Setting:

A safe and inviting environment can encourage open communication, while a distracting or unwelcoming space can hinder it. Here are some tips for setting the stage when preparing for your meeting or conversation:

Find a space where everyone can feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. Take into consideration, do you want the setting to be formal or more relaxed? Do you want tables or just chairs? How the space is arranged will affect how the process dynamic will go.

Set the tone by asking everyone to turn off their phones and other devices to have no distractions.

Give your full attention to the person speaking, and avoid interrupting or judging them. An open and respectful dialogue is fostered when you are willing to listen.

End the meeting with a summary and action items list to ensure that the meeting served its purpose.

By intentionally setting up the space in this way, you can create the conditions for a more productive and transformative experience that will positively impact your team's dynamic.

Building an environment that supports open communication and dialogue takes effort and intent, but it's a valuable investment. We invite you to play around and find ways that will work for you and keep in mind that it also takes time and persistence to build a culture of dialogue, but it’s worth it.

We invite you to try out our self-coaching processes for preparing your meetings and growing from past ones. Find them in the Dialogue Starters activity library.

How to look at photos and words?

A crucial part of working with Speak Up is to give time for observing the Photo cards and Word cards that are chosen. The act of observing images serves as a powerful tool for self- reflection, expression, and growth. By engaging in deep observation, we can access inner worlds, explore thoughts and emotions, and gain new perspectives from the images.

Our recommended way of observing photos is that once all the participants in your activity have chosen the Photo card you guide them, by asking a series of questions, which they should answer in their mind. It should take from 1-3 minutes. Afterwards you can continue to your chosen process.

#### Observing Photos

Some questions to ask to the photo:

What do I see in the photo?

What is the dominant color in the photo?

What detail is capturing my eye? Why is it important?

What happened just a minute before the photo was taken?

What is missing in the photo? What would I add to it?

Where would I place myself? If at all?

Do I like or dislike the photo? Why?

How do I feel about the photo?

#### How do all these connect with the issue that I/we are observing today?

#### Observing Words

Same as with the Photo card, when we pick a Word card it is also worth taking a time to observe the world itself. Here are a few questions that can enhance the way we look at the word that came to us:

What does this word mean to me?

What word has the opposite meaning?

What other words can I make up from the letters in this word?

How does the word change if I add Yes or No before it?

Do I like or dislike the word? Why?

What emotions, feelings or memories does this word arise in me?

#### How does the word connect with the photo that I am looking at?

# Employee Journey

We recognize that you will be supporting employees in different stages of their life cycle in the organization. We created special processes for each stage of the journey, to support your needs. It's a different conversation during a job interview, setting expectations while on- boarding or doing a follow up feedback process.

Here is our take on the employee journey.

Adaptability

I fall in. I am lost… I am helpless. It isn’t my fault.

It takes forever to find a way out.

#### Chapter 2

I walk down the same street.

There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don’t see it. I fall in again.

I can’t believe I am in the same place. But it isn’t my fault.

It still takes a long time to get out.

#### Chapter 3

I walk down the same street.

There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it is there.

I fall in… it’s a habit… but my eyes are open. I know where I am. It is my fault.

I get out immediately.

I walk around it.

I walk down a different street.

Boundaries

I’ve always equated being a good friend, teammate, and family member with doing whatever anyone asks of me. If someone needs help, you help. If someone’s having a get-together and invites you, you’d better be there. Saying no is rude, so never, ever say no. I think this is a common thing we teach little girls – always be polite and take care of everyone else before you take care of yourself.

Once I’d taken my neighbor to the airport at 4am that morning. She’d texted me the night before: “Hey. Can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow? At 4am?” Three grimacing emojis. I said yes, of course, and I showed up at 4am on the dot with my trunk popped. She got in my car and said, “Wow! I can’t believe you actually said yes. My husband is mad at me for asking you because he thought it was really rude. But I told him you said yes!”

I couldn’t stop thinking about that the whole way back home. Why did I say yes? Well, because I thought I couldn’t say no. It was that simple. The fact that even the asker was surprised I said yes made me think pretty deeply about my personal boundaries and that they were basically non-existent.

Would saying no to someone result in something terrible happening? Would it make someone swear me off as a friend? Of course not.

Others say no all the time, and it’s fine. I gave myself "permission" to say no to things I don’t want to do. Life is just too short to waste your time doing things for the sake of doing things. Kristen Hillery

Boundaries

Effective boundaries are not a matter of selfishness or being unfriendly. Rather, they are a way of ensuring that everyone gets the best from us.

Ken Blanchard

Boundaries are a part of self-care. They are healthy, normal, and necessary.

Doreen Virtue

Never assume you can’t do something. Push yourself to redefine the boundaries.

Brian Chesky

Boundaries are a part of leadership. You have to be able to set boundaries because you teach people how to treat you.

Oprah Winfrey

Saying no is the most powerful thing you can do. Saying no affirms what you stand for, and strengthens what you do.

Danielle LaPorte

#### How do I communicate my boundaries to others? Do I say No to my superiors?

#### How do I know when my boundaries are crossed at work?

#### What is one thing I can say no to today that will help me to create more time and space for the things that truly matter?

Burnout

I’d hit a wall. I was physically and emotionally burned out. I’d been working 80 to 100-hour weeks for years. At one point, I think I was averaging maybe four hours of sleep a night. I was living off of fast food and caffeine. I’d stopped exercising. I wasn’t making time for friends or family.

Eventually, I realized that I needed to make a change. I couldn’t keep going at that pace forever. So I started to prioritize self-care. I began exercising again. I made time for people I cared about. I started sleeping more. I even started meditating.

It wasn’t easy to break out of those old patterns, but it was necessary. And in the end, it made me a better leader. I had more energy and focus. I was able to approach challenges with a clearer mind. And I was happier. I realized that taking care of myself wasn’t just important for

Burnout is what happens when you try to avoid being human for too long.

Closure

Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question. Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?”

Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

Dr. Seuss

Closure is not about tying up loose ends, but about acknowledging the impact of past experiences and finding a way to integrate them into our lives.

John Whittington

Closure

Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.

She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter. It all depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little. If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.”

As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “our stresses, worries and unfinished closures in life are very much like this glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you release them.

Urban Legend

It is always important to know when something has reached its end. Closing circles, shutting doors, finishing chapters, it doesn't matter what we call it; what matters is to leave in the past those moments in life that are over.

Paulo Coelho

People of our time are losing the power of celebration. Celebration is an active state, an act of expressing reverence or appreciation. Celebration is a confrontation, giving attention to the transcendent meaning of one's actions.

Abraham Joshua Heschel

There is no real ending. It's just the place where you stop the story.

Frank Herbert

#### How are closures expressed in my team? How do I close things?

#### What is my next career step?

#### What do I need to leave behind in this moment?

Collaboration

In 2010, a group of Chilean miners became trapped underground when a mine collapsed. The miners were stranded in a small chamber more than 2,000 feet underground, with no means of communication or escape. Despite the dire situation, the miners banded together and formed a tight-knit team, relying on each other for support, encouragement, and survival. They rationed their food and water, took turns leading daily prayers and exercises, and even organized a "TV station" to keep themselves entertained and informed about the rescue efforts. After 69 days underground, all 33 miners were rescued in a miraculous feat of collaboration and teamwork between the miners, their families, and the rescue workers who worked tirelessly to save them.

Decisions

“Now the children prefer to work in Jakarta rather than returning to their hometowns to continue their parents' plantations.” said one of the farmers to Amanda Susanti Cole.

Apparently, this was caused by the difficulty in distributing the crops to the market. Seeing this opportunity, Amanda, who at that time had worked for two years in a chemical distribution company, decided to quit her job and open a garden with the help of her uncle. Amanda, who has had a hobby of farming since she was young, wants to help farmers by establishing easy distribution channels for farmers so that their crops can reach cities. Having skills in business and technology, in 2017 Amanda decided to open her first

business, Sayurbox. Selling vegetables digitally, which initially only started from using social media, has begun to expand using applications. Previously, Amanda only sold vegetables, now Amanda also provides a variety of other organic preparations that people can order easily at affordable prices. Sayurbox, which has partners with 300 farms and plantations, while serving 50,000 customers and making 1,000 deliveries every day, made Amanda the Seedstars Indonesia Winner, in the startup competition and received funding for her business in 2018, and was included in the ranks of Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia in 2019.

Dialogue

A man was sitting in a public garden, peacefully, holding a dog on a leash, dozing at his feet. A lady approaches, sits down next to him, looks at the dog for a moment and asks the man:

“Is your dog nice?”

“He is very nice,” the man replies.

The woman reaches out her hand to the dog, but it suddenly stands up and bites her ferociously.

“What did you say to me?” asks the woman, furious and bleeding. “You told me your dog was nice!”

“Mine is. That one is my sister's dog.”

himself so beautiful that he decreed that all the men in the city should henceforth dress like him, wear the same beard as him, and speak with the same voice as him. He added that anyone who did not obey would be punished by death.

Soon there were only men in the city who followed the king's example. Some time later, a terrible plague fell on the city. The frightened Ahmaq called upon God, who came down to the city.

But God did not find Ahmaq. All men were alike.

So God left, abandoning the city, its inhabitants and Ahmaq, its king, to their sad fate. Thus disappeared this city that had once been so beautiful.

”What do you want me to say?” The dragon replies. “This is YOUR dream!”

Fun

In the 1980s, the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle was on the brink of closure, with demotivated and unhappy employees struggling to keep the business afloat. John Yokoyama, a former employee turned owner, decided to make a change. During a meeting, an employee suggested they not only save the business but make it "world-famous" by introducing flying and thrown fish, games with customers, and staff attitudes of always enjoying their work.

With the decision made to try something new, a simple act of playfulness among the staff changed everything. They started to have fun, interact with customers, and make each other laugh. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish; the fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots will call out the order which is loudly shouted back by all the

other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter to be wrapped. The repeated shouting of fish orders started out as a prank on one employee, but became a tradition as the display was enjoyed by customers. When at work, the fish market's staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while throwing ordered fish. Occasionally they will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss. The market displays a sign in the general area which reads "Caution: Low Flying Fish".

The result was a dramatic turnaround in the business. The fish market became more profitable and started attracting more customers. The employees were happier and more motivated, and they took pride in their work. The fish market is a famous landmark in Seattle and has become a tourist attraction from all around the world because of the unique and lively atmosphere that the employees create.

Loyalty

In the 1920s, Hachiko's owner, Professor Hidesaburo Ueno, would take the dog on a train ride to work every day. Hachiko would then wait patiently at the train station for Ueno to return from work, and the two would walk home together.

Sadly, in 1925, while Ueno was at work, he had a sudden stroke and passed away, leaving Hachiko waiting at the Shibuya train station as usual. For the next nine years, Hachiko

showed unwavering loyalty by returning to the train station every day at the same time, waiting for his owner to return.

Even though Ueno never returned, Hachiko remained devoted, sleeping overnight at the train station and becoming a beloved sight to commuters, who would often bring him food and water.

Hachiko's loyalty touched the hearts of many, and after his death in 1935, a statue was erected at the Shibuya train station. The statue remains a symbol of loyalty and a reminder of the extraordinary bond between man and animal and loyalty isn't just a human quality – animals can display it too. Hachiko also reminds us that loyalty isn't just about being devoted to someone who is present, but also being steadfast even when they're not.

Out of the Box

There once was a man and a woman who had been married for more than 60 years. They talked about everything. They kept no secrets from each other... except the old woman had a shoebox in the top of her closet that she cautioned her husband never to open or ask about.

For all these years he had never thought about the box, but one day the old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover. In trying to sort out their affairs, the old man took down the shoebox and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found 2 beautifully crocheted doilies and a stack of money totaling over $25,000. He asked her about the unusual

contents. “When we were married,” she said, “my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doily.” The little old man was so moved, he had to fight back tears. Only two precious doilies were in the box. She had only been angry with him two times in all the years of living and loving. He almost burst with joy and happiness. “Sweetheart,” he said... “That explains the doilies, but what about all this money? Where did it all come from?” “Oh,” she said, “that's the money I made from selling the doilies.”

Once upon a time, there were six blind men who had heard about an elephant but had never encountered one. They were curious to know what an elephant was like, so they set out on a journey to find one. When they finally encountered an elephant, each of the blind men touched a different part of the animal to try and understand what it was like. The first blind man touched the elephant's trunk and exclaimed, “It's a snake!”

The second blind man touched the elephant's ear and exclaimed, “No, it's a fan!”

The third blind man touched the elephant's leg and exclaimed, “You're both wrong, it's a tree trunk!” The fourth blind man touched the elephant's side and exclaimed, “None of you know what you're talking about, it's a wall!”

The fifth blind man touched the elephant's tusk and exclaimed, “You're all mistaken, it's a spear!” The sixth and final blind man touched the elephant's tail and exclaimed, “You're all wrong, it's a rope!”

The six blind men argued back and forth about what the elephant was, each convinced that their own perception was the only correct one. They could not agree, and the argument grew more and more heated.

Finally, a wise man passing by overheard the argument and stopped to intervene. He explained to the blind men that each of them was partly right - they had just experienced different parts of the same thing. He encouraged them to work together and share their different perspectives in order to gain a more complete understanding of the elephant.

The blind men realized their mistake and apologized to each other. They began to discuss their perceptions of the elephant, and through their collaboration, they were able to gain a deeper understanding of what an elephant was really like.

Performance

There was a social experiment where teams of Harvard MBA graduate students were placed to compete against kindergartners. The challenge was which team will build the highest tower using only spaghetti sticks, string and tape. The graduate students took the challenge seriously. They approached the problem analytically, discussing how to best combine the sticks, string, and tape to achieve maximum altitude.

If you think the winners were the Harvard students, think again. The kindergartners drubbed them. Here’s why. The MBA spent most of their time speculating trying to figure everything out in advance. They also spent much time arguing who should be in charge. As a result, their constructions kept falling apart. But the kids got to work quickly. They tried one way of building. If didn’t work, they quickly tried another. They learned from their mistakes and got in a lot more tries. As a result, they quickly built one tall structure after another.

The MBA students spent too much time speculating on possible What If's while the kids moved quickly from What If to How to.

A monk set out on his travels across a faraway land. As night was falling he found a humble shack, in the middle of nowhere. A poor family lived there and the mother, father and children were dressed in rags. The monk asked if he could spend the night. “You are most welcome” they said and prepared a simple meal consisting of milk, cheese and cream. The monk greatly appreciated their simple generosity. When they finished eating, he asked how they managed to survive in such an isolated place. “We have one cow” said the wife, "We sell her milk to our neighbors and keep enough for our needs.”

The next morning, the monk said his goodbyes and set out to continue his journey. Not far from the family’s little hut, he came across the cow. The monk pondered for a moment before leading the cow to the edge of a nearby cliff and pushing it over the edge.

Several years later the monk again passed that same road where he found lodging so many years ago, and decided to visit the family. As he rounded the curve, he saw a splendid mansion, surrounded by landscaped gardens. The monk knocked on the door. The father answered, now well-dressed and looking healthy. He recognized the monk immediately. While they ate, the monk asked what had changed in the years that had passed. “You know, we used to have a cow.” explained the father, “She kept us alive. One day she fell down the cliff and died. To survive, we had to develop skills we didn’t know we had. We were forced to come up with new ways of doing things. It was the best thing that ever happened to us! We are now much better off than before.” The old monk smiled.

Priorities

Once there was a wise Zen master who had many students. One day, a student approached him and asked, “Master, how can I learn to prioritize my time and focus on what truly matters?” The Zen master paused for a moment and then said, “Let me show you.” He took out a glass jar and placed it on the table in front of the student. Then, he took a pile of large rocks and began to place them inside the jar until it was full.

“Is the jar full?” he asked the student. “Yes, Master,” the student replied.

The Zen master then took out a bag of smaller stones and poured them into the jar. The smaller stones filled the spaces between the large rocks until they reached the top of the jar.

You can do anything, but not everything.

“Is the jar full now?” he asked.

The student hesitated before answering, but then said, “Yes, Master.”

The Zen master then took out a bag of sand and poured it into the jar. The sand filled the tiny spaces between the large rocks and the small stones until the jar was completely full.

“Now, is the jar full?” he asked again.

The student, understanding the lesson, replied, “No, Master. There is still room for more." The Zen master smiled and said, “Exactly. The large rocks represent the most important things in your life, such as your family, your health, and your passions. The small stones represent the smaller, but still important things, like your job and your responsibilities. And the sand represents the little things in life that can easily fill up your time and distract you from what truly matters.”

He continued, “If you fill your jar with the sand first, you will have no room for the larger rocks and small stones. But if you prioritize the important things first, then the rest will fall into place. Remember to always focus on what truly matters and prioritize your time accordingly.”

Purpose

Finding purpose is not just an individual pursuit; it's also a collective one. It's about connection, and it's about living up to your values. It's about doing something that matters, and it's about being part of something bigger than yourself. Purpose doesn't have to be grand or noble, but it does have to be meaningful to you. And it does have to be based on your own strengths and interests.

It's important to remember that purpose is not a one-time thing. It's not something you find and then you're done. Purpose is a journey. It's a process of continually discovering what matters to you and what makes your heart sing. And it's something that evolves over time.

In order to find your purpose, it's important to take the time to reflect on your life and your experiences. What are the things that have brought you the most joy and fulfilment? What are the things that you're good at? What are the things that you care deeply about?

Once you have a better understanding of your strengths, interests, and values, you can start to look for ways to bring those things into your work and your life. You can start to ask yourself how you can use your unique talents and passions to make a difference in the world.

Remember, finding your purpose is not about achieving some external goal. It's about discovering who you are and what you stand for, and then living your life in alignment with that. It's about finding the courage to be true to yourself and to live a life that is authentically yours.

Struggle

Struggle is not an option, it’s a biological requirement. We need it to survive. In fact, life without struggle is life without growth. Struggle is the stimulus for growth. It is what triggers the need to adapt. And adapting is what helps us to evolve.

The struggle itself is not what we should avoid. It’s the unnecessary suffering that we should seek to eliminate. And the difference between struggle and unnecessary suffering is purpose. When we have a purpose, when we know why we’re struggling, then we can endure almost any struggle. It is the absence of purpose that makes struggle unbearable.

The fact is, without struggle, there can be no progress. It’s the struggle that forces us to evolve, to become better than we were before. It’s the struggle that forces us to look inside ourselves, to discover who we really are, and to discover what we’re truly capable of.

Struggle is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. It’s not a sign of failure, but a sign of growth. It’s not a sign of defeat, but a sign of progress. So embrace the struggle. Embrace the challenge. And know that it is the struggle that will make you stronger, wiser, and more resilient.

Egyptians would then use simple tools and techniques to create a system of irrigation canals that allowed them to control the flow of water to their crops.

They also practiced crop rotation, planting different crops in different fields each year to allow the soil to recover and replenish its nutrients. They used natural fertilizers, such as animal manure and compost, to enrich the soil and boost crop yields.

The ancient Egyptians also placed a high value on conserving resources and minimizing waste. They reused and recycled materials whenever possible, and even mummified their dead as a way of preserving their bodies for eternity.

Their sustainable farming practices, coupled with their resourcefulness and ingenuity, allowed the ancient Egyptians to sustain a thriving civilization for thousands of years. Their legacy serves as a reminder that sustainability is not a new concept, but rather an ancient and time-tested way of life that can guide us towards a more sustainable future.

The Earth system is incapable of organizing itself to deal with its vital problems: nuclear perils that are worsening with the dissemination and perhaps privatization of atomic weapons; degradation of the biosphere; a world economy without real regulation; the return of famines; ethno-politico-religious conflicts tending to develop into wars of civilization.

The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence – it is to act with yesterday’s logic.

Peter Drucker

The great solution to all human problems is individual inner transformation.

Vernon Howard

Transformation

The amplification and acceleration of all these processes can be seen as the unleashing of a formidable negative feedback, a process by which a system irremediably disintegrates.

The probable is disintegration. The improbable but possible is metamorphosis. What is a metamorphosis? We see countless examples in the animal kingdom. The caterpillar that encloses itself in a chrysalis then begins a process of both self-destruction and

self-reconstruction, according to an organization and a form of butterfly, other than the caterpillar, while remaining the same. The birth of life can be conceived as the metamorphosis of a physico-chemical organization, which, having reached a point of

saturation, has created the living meta-organization, which, while comprising the same physico-chemical constituents, has produced new qualities.

Edgar Morin - In Praise of Metamorphosis

The biggest challenge in digital transformation is to change the wheel of the car without stopping it.

Eric Blot

Transformation is not about improving. It's about re-thinking.

Malcolm Gladwell

Transformation is not a future event. It is a present activity.

Jillian Michaels

#### Does my position require me to transform? If yes, in what way? How do I respond to change?

#### What is my next career step?

#### Do I believe in revolution or evolution?

Uncertainty

Once a very educated young professor with multiple PhDs but with little life experience was traveling on a ship. In the same ship was an illiterate old sailor. Every evening the sailor

There’s one thing worse than change and that’s the status quo.

John le Carre

Uncertainty

would come to listen to the professor's lectures. One evening, the professor asked the sailor “Old man, do you know geology?” “What is that sir?” “Old man, it is the science of the earth on which we are living.” “Sir, I have never been to school. I have never studied geology.” “Old man, you have wasted a quarter of your life.” The old man thought “if such a learned person says so, it must be true. I have wasted a quarter of my life.” Next evening, the professor was delivering a lecture on oceanography. Like the previous day, the professor asked “Old man, do you know oceanography?” “What is that sir?” “Old man, it is the science of the ocean on which we are traveling.” “No sir. As I have told you earlier, I have never

been to any school or college. I don’t know oceanography.” “Old man, you are staying on this earth, but you don’t know geology. You are earning your living from the ocean, but you don’t know oceanography. You have wasted two quarters of your life.” The old sailor was very unhappy. He thought to himself “When such a learned person says that I have wasted two quarters of my life, I must have wasted two quarters of my life.” Next day, the sailor came running to the professor and asked: “Professor, do you know swimology?” “What is that old man?” “Do you know how to swim?” “I don’t know how to swim.” “Professor, you certainly have wasted all your life. The ship is sinking. Those who can swim, can go to the nearby shore. Those who can’t swim, will drown with the ship.” We may learn all the "logy" of the world and debate on them. But if we don’t know swimology, we may drown some day. We may read books on swimming, but we learn how to swim only after entering the water. There are situations in life when problems seem like a never-ending ocean and all the other "logy" of the world don’t help much. We all must learn swimology to swim through our ocean.

Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.

John Allen Paulos

One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.

Andre Gide

In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.

Warren Buffett

When 99% of people doubt your idea, you’re either gravely wrong or about to make history.

Scott Belsky

#### How do I navigate and handle uncertain situations? What am I sure of in my life?

#### If I take the risk what can I gain?

#### How uncertainty shapes my organizational environment?

Walk the Talk

Mandela: You look agitated Jason.

Jason: Well that’s because there are four special branch cops in my office Mandela: Oh, what did you do?

Jason: Nothing. They say they’re the Presidential bodyguards. They have orders, signed by you.

Mandela: Ah yes. These men are special trained by SAS. They have lots of experience, they protected the clerk.

Jason: Doesn’t mean that they have… Mandela: You asked for more men, didn’t you? Jason: Yes, sir, I asked…

Mandela: When people see me in public, they see my body guards. You represent me directly. A rainbow nation, starts here. Reconciliation, starts here.

Jason: Reconciliation, Sir? Mandela: Yes, reconciliation, Jason.

Jason: Mr. President, not long ago, these guys tried to kill us. Maybe even these four guys in my office tried and often succeeded.

Mandela: Yes, I know. Forgiveness starts here too. Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear that is why it is such a powerful weapon.

Invictus - Movie Produced by Clint Eastwood

Walk the Talk

The most important thing in life is to be true to yourself. The second most important thing is to be true to others.

Sheryl Sandberg

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do is in harmony.

Mahatma Gandhi

What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.

Ralph Waldo Emerson

Your personal brand is a promise to your clients... a promise of quality, consistency, competency, and reliability.

Jason Hartman

People want to see something that shows them you can do what you say. That's the trick.

Christopher Nolan

#### How do I walk the talk in my team/organization? What does integrity mean to me?

#### How do I feel when someone doesn’t walk their talk in my team? What price do I pay when I don’t walk my talk?

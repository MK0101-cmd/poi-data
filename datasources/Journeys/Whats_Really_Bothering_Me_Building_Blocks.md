**Facilitator Guidelines**

-   **Set the Tone**: This workshop touches on personal concerns. Ensure
    a safe, supportive atmosphere.

-   **Balance Depth with Lightness**: Use humor and grounding when
    needed.

-   **Model Openness**: Demonstrate vulnerability and curiosity.

-   **Guide Reflection, Don't Fix**: Allow participants to discover
    insights without rushing into solutions.

-   **Encourage Mirroring**: Teach participants to reflect what they
    see, not interpret or analyze.

**Detailed Flow**

**1. Opening & Pause (20 min)**

-   **Facilitator Script**:

"Welcome back. Today we'll work with ClicKit to explore something that's
troubling us, to see it in a new light, and to uncover the need beneath
it. As we do, let's remember: even when we touch difficulties, there is
always light we can bring."

-   **Pause Ritual (5 min)**: Play a short music piece. Invite
    participants to reflect on *"What do I want to shine light on
    today?"*. Each lights a candle and shares one word aloud.

-   **Individual Writing (2 min)**: In their notebook, each writes:
    *"What issue am I defining right now as a problem? Where does it
    show up? Why does it bother me?"*

**2. Expansion -- Defining & Representing the Problem (85 min)**

**Step 1 -- Defining the Problem (20 min)**

-   Participants choose one **photo card** from their ClicKit set that
    represents their troubling issue.

-   **Pair Sharing (5 min each)**: Share with a partner what is
    troubling you, using the chosen card.

-   **Mirroring (2 min)**: Partner writes on a sticky note: *"What I
    hear is troubling you is..."*.

**Step 2 -- Creating a Representation (30 min)**

-   Using ClicKit canvas, cards, stickers, and creative materials,
    participants create a **visual representation of their problem**.

-   Encourage them to explore: What elements make up this issue? How
    much space does it take? What emotions/colors/images show up?

**Step 3 -- External Mirroring (35 min)**

-   Work in triads. Each participant presents their creation **without
    explaining the problem**.

-   The other two offer reflections: *"I see..."*, *"This reminds me
    of..."*, *"What speaks to me is..."*.

-   After receiving reflections, each writes: *"What did I learn from
    others' mirrors?"*

**3. Break (30 min)**

**4. Focus -- Identifying the Unmet Need (20 min)**

-   Return to the created representation and reflections.

-   Journaling prompts:

    -   *Has the problem shifted in meaning?*

    -   *What if this "problem" is simply an unmet need?*

    -   *What is the need that seeks expression or fulfillment?*

-   Short circle sharing: each names the need they discovered.

**5. Action -- Exploring Practical Responses (20 min)**

-   **Individual Reflection (5 min)**:

    -   How would I like to meet this need?

    -   What depends only on me?

    -   How can I communicate this need to others?

-   **Pair Exchange (5 min each)**: Share the identified need and
    brainstorm possible responses or communication strategies.

**6. Closing & Integration (30 min)**

-   **Group Discussion**:

    -   What happened for me in this process?

    -   What insights am I taking away?

    -   How does working with ClicKit support me?

-   **Facilitator Input**: Offer examples of other ClicKit applications:

    -   Vision board creation (for a new year, new role, or transition).

    -   "My Story" processes.

    -   Dream mapping (identifying obstacles, resources, and refined
        goals).

-   **Final Round**: Each shares one word or sentence capturing what
    they are leaving with.

**Participant Guidelines**

-   Trust your first choices -- let the cards and materials guide you.

-   Stay curious about your "problem" -- don't rush to solve it.

-   Listen deeply when others share; reflect only what you see, not
    advice.

-   Look for the **need beneath the problem** -- that's where growth
    begins.

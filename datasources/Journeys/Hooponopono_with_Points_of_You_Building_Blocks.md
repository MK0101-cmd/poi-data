**Ho'oponopono with Points of You®**

*A Journey of Healing, Forgiveness, and Coming Home to the Heart*

**1. Introduction for Facilitators**

**What is Ho'oponopono?**\
Ho'oponopono is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and
forgiveness. The word means "to make right" or "to correct."
Traditionally, it was used in families and communities to resolve
conflicts, restore harmony, and reconnect with the spirit of Aloha ---
compassion, love, and unity.

The practice revolves around four simple yet profound phrases:

-   **I'm sorry**

-   **Please forgive me**

-   **Thank you**

-   **I love you**

Together, they create a healing cycle that clears resentment, guilt, and
pain, making space for peace and connection.

**Why combine with Points of You®?**\
While Ho'oponopono is inward and spiritual, Points of You® tools
(images, words, metaphors) allow participants to express, visualize, and
process the experience in a safe and creative way. The tools give shape
to emotions and stories that are often hard to verbalize directly,
helping participants deepen their journey of forgiveness and compassion.

**2. Objectives of the Workshop**

-   To introduce participants to the essence and philosophy of
    Ho'oponopono.

    for reflection and storytelling.

**Opening (20 min)**

-   **Facilitator words:**\
    "Today we are going on a journey of forgiveness, compassion, and
    release. Ho'oponopono is a practice that can heal wounds within us
    and between us. With the help of Points of You® tools, we will give
    images and words to these feelings, allowing them to unfold gently."

-   Invite participants to take a deep breath, close their eyes for a
    minute, and silently repeat: *I'm here, I'm safe, I'm open.*

**Part 1: Exploring the Four Phrases (30 min)**

Introduce each phrase, one by one. After reading it aloud, pause for
reflection.

1.  **I'm sorry** -- Acknowledging responsibility and the existence of
    pain.

    -   Question for reflection: *Where in my life do I feel sorrow that
        I haven't expressed?*

2.  **Please forgive me** -- Requesting release, from self or others.

    -   Question: *Whom do I need to ask for forgiveness, including
        myself?*

3.  **Thank you** -- Recognizing the gift hidden even in challenges.

    -   Question: *What am I grateful for in this situation?*

4.  **I love you** -- The ultimate vibration of healing.

    -   Question: *What does it mean for me to choose love here?*

Use one Point of You® card for each phrase. Let participants reflect
silently for 2--3 minutes per card.

**Part 2: Personal Process with Cards (60 min)**

-   **Instructions:**\
    Each participant selects 4 cards (face down or face up):

    -   One card for *I'm sorry*

    -   One card for *Please forgive me*

    -   One card for *Thank you*

    -   One card for *I love you*

-   Participants journal their insights. Suggested prompts:

    -   *What story does this image tell me about the phrase?*

    -   *What emotion arises?*

    -   *What connection do I see between the four cards?*

-   **Sharing in pairs/triads (30 min):**\
    Each participant shares their 4 cards and reflections while the
    others listen with presence and empathy.

**Part 3: Integration Ritual (40 min)**

-   Ask participants to bring their 4 cards and place them in the center
    of the room, creating a collective mandala.

-   As a group, recite the four phrases together, slowly and with
    intention.

-   Facilitator may play soft music.

-   Silence for 2 minutes to let the energy integrate.

**Part 4: Closing (30 min)**

-   Circle sharing: "One word or sentence I take with me."

-   Encourage participants to commit to practicing the four phrases
    daily, even silently.

-   **Optional visualization:** Guide a short meditation where
    participants imagine sending the four phrases to someone in their
    life, and then to themselves.

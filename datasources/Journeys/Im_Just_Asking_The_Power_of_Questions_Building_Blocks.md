**Facilitator Guidelines**

-   **Emphasize Listening**: Questions are only powerful when connected
    to the present moment.

-   **Active Presence**: Notice not just words, but tone, pace, and body
    language.

-   **Less is More**: Avoid rushing into advice or solutions; stay
    curious.

-   **Encourage Embodiment**: Begin with a physical pause to reset body
    and mind.

-   **Frame the Workshop**: Questions are the gateway to insight and
    transformation.

**Detailed Flow**

**1. Opening & Welcome (30 min)**

-   **Facilitator Script**:

"Good morning, I'm so glad to see you here today. Let's start with a
smile and a story. Do you know the joke about the father and son...? The
son keeps asking questions, and the father always answers: 'I don't
know.' Finally, the son apologizes for bothering him. But the father
says: 'Not at all, my son. If you don't ask, how will you ever know?'
Questions are the engine of learning, exploration, and growth."

-   Introduce the **focus of the day**:

    1.  Identifying the *real question* beneath what is first spoken.

    2.  Holding space for powerful questions.

    3.  Practicing "improvised conversations."

-   **Pause Exercise (20 min)**: Play music (Ani Kini, 4:36). Invite
    participants to move freely, shake off distractions, and then return
    to stillness.

-   **Check-in Round**: "How am I today?" Each participant shares with
    one word or sentence.

**2. What's the Real Question? (45 min)**

-   **Input**: Explain that the presenting question is rarely the true
    one. Share examples:

    -   A client brings a topic, but underneath lies the real challenge.

    -   In "My Story" workshops, identifying the right theme for the
        album.

    -   When participants struggle to articulate what doesn't sit right
        in a process.

-   **Key Learning**: A powerful question emerges through **active
    listening**, not a pre-written list.

**3. Pair Practice: Finding the Core Question (20 min)**

-   **Activity**:

    1.  Form pairs.

    2.  Each takes 10 minutes as facilitator/participant.

    3.  Focus topic: *"What takes me out of my comfort zone?"* (personal
        or professional).

    4.  The goal is not to solve, but to identify **the real question**
        worth exploring today.

-   **Closing instruction**: Each person writes down their emerging
    question.

**4. Group Discussion (20 min)**

-   Guiding prompts:

    -   What helped me guide someone to their real question?

    -   What made it challenging?

    -   Why is a bank of "good questions" an illusion?

    -   How do listening, tone, body language, and silence guide us to
        the deeper question?

**5. Break (30 min)**

**6. Improvised Conversation Method (90 min)**

Introduce the **Points of You速 4-step method**:

1.  **Pause** -- stop, breathe, center.

2.  **Expand** -- use cards, questions, and metaphors to broaden
    perspectives.

3.  **Focus** -- narrow down insights into a clear takeaway.

4.  **Action** -- translate insights into practical next steps.

**a. Demonstration (15 min)**

-   Invite a volunteer. Facilitate a 15-minute improvised conversation
    using the method.

**b. Group Debrief (15 min)**

-   What did you notice?

-   How did the facilitator identify and refine the question?

-   How did the cards support the process?

**c. Pair Practice Round 1 (20 min)**

-   New pairs. One facilitates, one participates.

-   Structure:

    1.  Identify the core question.

    2.  Choose a hidden photo card and/or word card.

    3.  Select one guiding question from the handout.

    4.  Conclude with a word summary.

**d. Short Break (10 min)**

**e. Pair Practice Round 2 (20 min)**

-   Switch roles. Repeat the process.

**7. Closing Reflection & Updates (45 min)**

-   **Sharing Circle**:

    -   What remains open for me after today?

    -   Which question still resonates most strongly?

-   **Facilitator Note**: End with updates on what's new at Points of
    You速 -- especially the shift towards organizational work, the
    creation of new workshops, and integration of tool sales into
    facilitation.

**Participant Guidelines**

-   Be curious, not judgmental.

-   Trust the process -- let the cards and questions guide you.

-   Listen deeply, both when you speak and when you hold space for
    others.

-   Take away one **resonating question** as your compass for the coming
    weeks.

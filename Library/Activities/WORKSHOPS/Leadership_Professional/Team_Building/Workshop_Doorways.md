## Process Framework
Based on **The Coaching Game's 4 steps**: **Pause → Expand → Focus → Action**  

### Step 1: Introduction
- Script: Introduce concept of reframing, positive psychology, and the Doorways metaphor.  
- Emphasize fun, dynamic group process with serious outcomes.  

### Step 2: Pause
- Quiet reflection with music.  
- Focus on breath.  
- Prompt: "Glass half full or half empty?"  

### Step 3: Expand — Personal Reflection
- Use Coaching Game cards to reflect on personal closed/open doors.  
- Prompts:  
  - What's the most important door that closed?  
  - What opened after it?  
  - What other doors might have opened?  

### Step 4: Focus — Organizational Reflection
- Using Coaching Game cards, reflect in pairs:  
  - Identify 3 doors that the organization needs to open or close.  
  - Share and exchange perspectives with a partner.  
  - Together, choose 1 door to close and 1 to open.  

### Step 5: Action — Planning
- For chosen doorway: define 3 actions:  
  - **Now:** This week  
  - **Next:** Next month  
  - **Later:** Next 6 months  
- Post ideas on room posters.  

### Step 6: Sharing Results
- Walk around and view postings, or share orally.  
- Facilitator/leader collates into action plans for follow-up.

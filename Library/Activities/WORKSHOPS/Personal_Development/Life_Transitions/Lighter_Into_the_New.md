## Objectives
- Identify one pattern or weight that no longer serves.  
- Explore what it once gave and what it now costs.  
- Consciously release it with clarity and self-respect.  
- Recognize supports needed when old reflexes return.  

---

## Opening (15 min)
- Introduction: This isn’t about resolutions, it’s about making space.  
- Prompt questions:  
  - *What am I already carrying?*  
  - *What am I ready to let go of?*  

---

## Pause (5 min)
- Background music.  
- **Writing prompt:** “What’s in my inner container that feels heavy?”  
- Deepening prompts:  
  - What have I been carrying long-term?  
  - Does it appear in one area or everywhere?  
  - How does it manifest (thoughts, emotions, behavior)?  
  - How does it feel in my body?

## Expanding

### Naming the Weight (10 min)
- Use **Speak Up** cards.  
- Choose one card face up to represent what you’ve been carrying.  
- Reflection: emotion, pattern, belief, narrative.  

### What Did This Give Me? (30 min)
- Pair activity (10 min each).  
- Speaker: Share what you’ve been carrying and what it once gave.  
- Prompts:  
  - What did this give me in the past?  
  - What need/fear did it protect?  
- Listener: Hold space, ask:  
  - What was valuable?  
  - Is it still needed?  
  - What might this part still ask for?  

### Am I Ready to Let This Go? (10 min)
- Journaling prompts:  
  - What am I choosing to release today?  
  - Am I ready — yes, not yet, maybe?  
- Choose another Speak Up card to reflect:  
  - *What might support me in letting go?*  
  - *What quality or energy can help me move forward?*  

---

## Focus & Doing (15 min)
- Reflect on two cards (release + support).  
- Journaling prompts:  
  - How does this support the shift I’m ready for?  
  - What reminder can I carry when old patterns return?  
- Write one supportive sentence/mantra (examples: “I trust myself without proving”; “This weight no longer belongs to me”).  
- Visualization: Imagine old pattern falling away, feel lightness and space.  

---

## Closing (5 min)
- Group sharing of supportive statements or decisions.  
- End with inspiration and collective encouragement.

# The Ideal and the Reality – Building Blocks

## Objective
To explore and reduce the **gap between your ideal position and your current reality**.

---

## Pause
Choose a topic from your life where you’d like to reflect (problem, decision, relationship, or stage in a process).  
Clearly write down the topic you chose.  

---

## Cards / Prompts
Choose **3 cards** (face up or face down).  
Each card corresponds to a reflective question:

1. What is the ideal?  
2. What is the reality?  
3. What’s missing in order to bridge between the two?

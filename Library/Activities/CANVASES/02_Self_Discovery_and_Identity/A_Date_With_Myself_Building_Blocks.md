# A Date With Myself â€“ Building Blocks

## Objective
A meeting with yourself.  
Create space for self-reflection and clarity.

## Pause
Before starting the process, begin with a mindful pause.  
Questions to ask yourself:
- How am I feeling?  
- What thoughts are coming and going?  
- When was the last time I paused?

This sets the tone before reflection begins.

**Corporate Day -- Unmasking the Leader Within**

**Facilitator's Guide**

**Introduction**

**Context for Corporate Audiences:**\
In today's fast-changing business environment, leadership requires more
than technical expertise. It demands authenticity, awareness, and the
courage to balance the **roles we perform** with the **identity we
choose to embody.**

professionals:

-   Reflect on the "mask" they wear in organizational life.

-   Explore the difference between persona and authentic self.

-   Reconnect with their leadership identity.

-   Envision the leader they aspire to become.

**Part 1 -- Opening & Welcome (30 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Build energy, connection, and a sense of presence.

**Facilitator Flow:**

1.  Welcome participants. Acknowledge their commitment to pause from
    daily demands.

2.  Short introductions: "Who are you? One word that describes how you
    arrive today."

3.  **Embodied Leadership Exercise:** Invite participants to move around
    the room, shifting between leading/following, inward/outward,
    quiet/energetic.

**Learning Outcome:**\
Participants experience leadership not as a title, but as a dynamic
presence in action.

**Part 2 -- Why Are You Here? (20 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Anchor the session in personal meaning.

**Flow:**

1.  Ask the central question: *"Why are you here today?"*

2.  Individual reflection: write down 2--3 sentences.

3.  Pair or triad sharing.

4.  Group harvest: collect keywords of intention (e.g. growth, clarity,
    connection).

**Tools:**

-   Use **ClicKit cards** to symbolize their personal "why."

-   Sharing in a circle: each participant briefly presents their chosen
    card.

**Learning Outcome:**\
Participants clarify their motivation and bring personal ownership into
the process.

**Part 3 -- Jung & The Mask (40 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Introduce Jung's concept of the **Persona** and connect it
to leadership.

**Facilitator Story:**

-   The **mask (persona)** is the role we adopt to function in society
    and business.

-   It is not "fake." It is **functional** -- it helps us succeed and be
    accepted.

-   But it is not the full story. Behind the mask lies a deeper,
    authentic self.

**Quote for framing:**\
*"It's not fake. It's functional. But it's not the whole story."*

**Guided Discussion:**

-   Where does the mask serve you as a leader?

-   Where does it limit you?

-   How would your leadership change if you dropped or expanded your
    mask?

**Individual Questions (journaling):**

1.  What title, role, or label do I carry in my professional life?

2.  What does this mask not reveal about me?

3.  Where would I like to stop hiding behind the mask?

**Transition:** Move toward *Leadership Identity.*

**Part 4 -- Exploring Leadership Persona (30 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Move from reflection into aspiration and vision.

**Facilitator Flow:**

-   Present the two guiding objectives of the workshop:

    1.  **Explore your leadership persona** -- how you show up, lead,
        act, and impact others.

    2.  **Tune in to the leader you choose to become.**

-   Invite participants to select a new **ClicKit card** to represent
    the leader they aspire to be.

-   In pairs: share the meaning of their chosen card and what it
    symbolizes for their future leadership.

-   Group reflection: collect insights and patterns --- what leadership
    qualities are emerging across the room?

**Learning Outcome:**\
Participants articulate a **vision of leadership** that goes beyond
their current role.

**Part 5 -- Closing & Commitments (15 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Integration and forward movement.

**Flow:**

1.  Invite each participant to share **one word** they take with them.

2.  Ask 2--3 volunteers to share a full takeaway sentence:

    -   *"What's one action you're ready to take as a leader?"*

3.  Acknowledge the group and close with gratitude.

**Learning Outcome:**\
Participants leave with clarity, inspiration, and a small but concrete
action step.

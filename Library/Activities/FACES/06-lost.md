# LOST SERIES

The places where we lose our way.

These are the stuck parts. Those dark places we have no idea how to get out of. These are the moments in which we feel small. These are vulnerable, victim-like, voiceless parts which cause us to lose faith quickly and give up - mainly on ourselves.

## Reflections in this Series

### Desperate
/ CONFUSED / INDECISIVE / ALWAYS SEARCHING /

**Story:**
It happens that a man is born into a foreign country. That although he has a father and a mother, brothers and sisters, language and culture – he is really from a different place, and he does not know it. He suffers all his life, until he understands, and begins his journey back to his country of origin, where no one has ever been and no one can promise him whether it really exists. This sort of man is born into hell, and at first does not know he is in hell. He goes on living his life and stumbling repeatedly, and only after a long time something happens: a moment of grace, where he earns a glimpse of a vision, just for a moment, of his own place. A snippet of a postcard from his place. Or someone from there passes by him, smiling – a moment which changes his life, because once and for all he understands that this place exists. That he is not dreaming. That there are lives better than his current life. And of course, in that moment he also understands that he is living in hell.

**Story:**
"How are you?" said Winnie-the-Pooh.

"Not very how," answered Eeyore the donkey. "I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time."

"Dear, dear," said Pooh, "I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you." So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once.

"Why, what's happened to your tail?" he said in surprise. "What has happened to it?" said Eeyore.

"It isn't there!" "Are you sure?"

"Well, either a tail is there or it isn't there. You can't make a mistake about it. And yours isn't there!"

"Then what is?" "Nothing."

"Let's have a look," said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the place where his tail had been a little while ago, "I believe you're right. That accounts for a Good Deal," said Eeyore gloomily. "It explains Everything. No Wonder."

"You must have left it somewhere," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "Somebody must have taken it," said Eeyore.

"How Like Them," he added, after a long silence.

### Passive
/ SUBMISSIVE / MANAGED / INDIFFERENT / BYSTANDER /

**Story:**
A beautiful girl in the village was pregnant. Her angry parents demanded to know who was the father. At first resistant to confess, the anxious and embarrassed girl finally pointed to Hakuin, the Zen master whom everyone previously revered for living such a pure life. When the outraged parents confronted Hakuin with their daughter's accusation, he simply replied "Is that so?"

When the child was born, the parents brought it to the Hakuin, who now was viewed as a pariah by the whole village. They demanded that he take care of the child since it was his responsibility. "Is that so?" Hakuin said calmly as he accepted the child.

For many months he took very good care of the child until the daughter could no longer withstand the lie she had told. She confessed that the real father was a young man in the village whom she had tried to protect. The parents immediately went to Hakuin to see if he would return the baby. With profuse apologies they explained what had happened. "Is that so?" Hakuin said as he handed them the child.

### Pleaser
/ OKAY WITH EVERYTHING / NICE PERSON / CLINGY /

**Story:**
An old Miller and his Son were on their way to market with an Ass which they hoped to sell. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed at them. "What foolishness! To walk when they might as well ride." The Miller told his son to climb up and ride. Three merchants passed by. "Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let the old man ride." The Miller made the boy get down and climbed up to ride. At the next turnstile, they saw some women. "Look at the old fool," exclaimed one of them. "Perched on the Ass, while that boy has to walk." The miller told the Boy to climb up behind him. A loud shout went up from another company of people on the road. "What a crime, to load up a poor beast like that!" The Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. The Ass began to kick and bray, and just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river.

### Naive
/ INNOCENT / CHILD / ANGEL / GULLIBLE /

**Story:**
"Does Mister God love us truly?"

"Sure thing" I said. "Mister God loves everything."

"Oh" she said. "well then, why does he let things get hurt and dead?" Her voice sounded as if she felt she had betrayed a sacred trust, but the question had been thought and it had to be spoken.

"I don't know," I replied. "There're a great many things about Mister God, we don't know about?"

"Well then," she continued, "if we don't know many things about Mister God, how do we know he loves us?"

She was silent for a little while. Later I thought that at this moment she was taking her last look at babyhood. Then she went on. "Fynn, Mister God doesn't love us." She hesitated. "He doesn't really, you know, only people can love." It sounded to me like a death knell. "Damn and blast," I thought. "Why does this have to happen to people? Now she's lost everything."

But I was wrong.

She had got both feet planted firmly on the next stepping stone. "No," she went on, "no, he don't love me, not like you do, its different, it's millions of times bigger."

### Wounded
/ BRUISED / HURT / MESSED UP /

**Story:**
I carried my broken heart in a dripping white bag back to the store and demanded a refund.

"But lady, excuse me, you got it half off. And you told me yourself, although you've been warned, that you won't regret it, no matter how bold. It hurts? WHY OF COURSE. It's a fine beating heart. It shines now and then, and it hurts all the time. Don't you lower your head, don't you cover your eyes! Not for nothing you brightened your days with bright stars, with pink pixie dust, with dreams and with trust! 'Cause you've been there, remember? This wasn't some cheat. You smiled and you hovered before you were "teased". You enjoyed the great taste and you sipped on the bliss. Why should you cry and declare it's a miss? The heart, as all flowers, is seasonal, dear. It feeds on the sun rays and blossoms! Quite clear. And then - it decays, as all life tends to act. It's sad and it's painful - but baby, that's that! So here, take your bag, and go wander back home. It might not be easy, but there's a nice view. Be very patient, clear out your head - let your heartbeats declare if they're living or dead."

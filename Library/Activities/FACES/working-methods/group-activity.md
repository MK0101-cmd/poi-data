# Group Activity - "My Facebook Profile Picture"

## About the Process

A group observational process, which deals with the differences in the way we see ourselves versus the way other people see us. A deep process which starts out lightly and gradually turns from being cognitive to being emotional.

## Setup

### Number of Participants
8-20 participants (if larger, we recommend dividing into smaller groups)

### Time Frame
120 minutes (for a group of up to 20 participants)

### Materials Needed
- 1 set of FACES
- A notebook and something to write with for each participant
- Sticky notes (about 25 for each participant)

### Preparation
Before the workshop, make sure to organize the FACES Photo cards facing up in the middle of the room.

## Process Steps

### 1. Introduction
Say to the participants: "Today we will work with FACES, a new game by Points of You. A direct and powerful way to get to know ourselves through the observation of others."

### 2. Choosing a Photo Card
After introducing the process, invite the participants to "change" their profile pictures on Facebook - and choose the photo which expresses them best according to this moment. Tell them to try to make their choice as intuitive as possible - to just choose an image that they like (3 minutes to choose.) After everyone chose cards, pick up the ones that were not chosen.

**Photo Card Integration**: Use [PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md](../PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md) to help participants understand which series their selected card belongs to and explore relevant content during the process.

**Reflection Card Integration**: Use [REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md](../REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md) to help participants understand which series their selected Reflection Card belongs to and use page numbers to access specific content.

### 3. Writing a Profile
Ask everyone to look at the image as if it were a mirror, then ask:
- Who's in the image?
- What are their names?
- Where are they from?
- Where do they live? In the village? In the city?
- How many children do they have, if any?
- What do they do?
- What do they love?
- Who do they love?
- What was the last thing they posted on their wall?
- What books do they read?

You then invite the participants to each write his/her own Facebook Profile for the person on the card. (10 minutes) During the time given for writing, you may continue guiding the participants with questions.

### 4. Gathering in a Circle
Ask the participants to take with them their profile pictures and to organize the chairs in a tight circle and have the back of them facing the center of the room. Hand each participant a stack of sticky memo notes.

### 5. A Round of Points of View
Explain to the participants: "I will soon ask each of you to pass your card to the participant sitting to your right. The card will be in the hands of the new participant for 3 minutes before again passing right, until it is back where it started. During the 3 minutes in which you will be holding the card, you will have to do three things:

**First minute**: Just observe.
**Second minute**: Write in your notebook intuitively.
**Third minute**: Choose a word or a sentence to be a title to the image, and write it down on one of the sticky memo notes. Then stick it to the back of the card. When the time is up, pass the card to the right, with the notes that are on it."

### 6. Guiding Questions
During the observational stage, use these guiding questions:
- What was your first reaction when you received this image?
- What does this face express?
- Which character do you see?
- What would you like to say to the character in front of you?
- What is it trying to tell you?
- What do you feel when you look at it?
- What do you like or dislike about it?
- What is this character hiding?
- Do you trust it?
- Could you be friends?
- If you allow yourself to be judgmental - what would you say about it?
- Who does it look like?
- Who does it remind you of?

### 7. Sharing
The round ends when each participant receives his/her own profile picture once again. Once this happens, everyone can go back to sitting in their original spots. You then ask the participants to each open up a 2-page spread in their notebooks and stick inside all the memo notes, then proceed to read his/her initial Facebook profile, the intuitive writing and the "titles" gathered for them on the notes. You then start the sharing part of the process. You tell the participants that they may share about anything they experienced during the process. During the sharing part, you may ask:
- Which memo note was your favorite?
- Which didn't you like?
- How well does your profile reflect who you are?
- Which series does your Photo Card belong to? (Use [PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md](../PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md) for reference)
- How does this connect to the stories and quotes in that series?
- Which series does your Reflection Card belong to? (Use [REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md](../REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md) for reference)
- How do your Photo Card and Reflection Card work together?

### 8. Closing
In this last round of sharing, you ask them to share what he/she is taking away from the workshop. Before you part, ask the participants to write the character a letter.

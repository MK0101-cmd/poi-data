# TAKERS SERIES

The places where we are mean to ourselves and to others.

After meeting our "taker" parts, there is less. Less energy, less confidence, less joy, less peacefulness... These are the parts which awaken feelings of shame, insecurity, doubt and fear.

## Reflections in this Series

### Selfish
/ NARCISSIST / UTILITARIAN / EGOIST /

**Story:**
I think, therefore I am is the statement of an intellectual who underrates toothaches. I feel, therefore I am is a truth much more universally valid, and it applies to everything that's alive. My self does not differ substantially from yours in terms of its thought.

Many people, few ideas: we all think more or less the same, and we exchange, borrow, steal thoughts from one another. However, when someone steps on my foot, only I feel the pain. The basis of the self is not thought but suffering, which is the most fundamental of all feelings. While it suffers, not even a cat can doubt its unique and uninterchangeable self. In intense suffering the world disappears and each of us is alone with himself.

Suffering is the university of egocentrism.

*Milan Kundera - Immortality*

- To be successful you have to be selfish, or else you never achieve. And once you get to your highest level, then you have to be unselfish. Stay reachable. Stay in touch. Don't isolate. - *Michael Jordan*

### Arrogant
/ STUCK UP / SNOBBISH / CONCEITED / SELF ESTEEM /

**Story:**
A minister came back from a trip abroad with a very expensive roll of fabric. The minister invited a tailor over to his mansion. "I am expecting something very special." He said.

While the tailor was working, he envisioned all the praise he would be receiving for the minister's new and unique suit. But, after trying on the suit, the minister turned red with anger. The embarrassed tailor returned home depressed. And that very same day the tailor drove over to his Rabbi. The Rabbi said: "Go back to your home, unravel the suit until it is just fabric once more, and stitch it up again right away. Take the new suit back to the minister and ask him to try it on again."

The tailor returned to his home, unraveled it, and stitched it back together, and with his new craftwork returned to the mansion again. To his surprise, the minister was thrilled. The tailor did not understand what had happened – it was the exact same suit! "When you first stitched up the minister's suit you did it with vanity and with thoughts about your own dignity. But pride has no charm, and neither did the suit. I was certain that if you tried to stitch it up again, this time in a humbler manner, it will be loved by everyone. And so, it was!" Smiled the Rabbi.

### Spoiled
/ PRINCESS / LAZY / DESERVED /

**Story:**
Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a real princess.

One evening a terrible storm came on. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate.

It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. The water ran down from her hair and clothes... And yet she said that she was a real princess.

"Well, we'll soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bedroom, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider- down beds on top of the mattresses.

On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning, she was asked how she had slept.

"Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!" Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea.

### Stubborn
/ INFLEXIBLE / SEES ONLY ONE WAY / DETERMINED / GREEDY /

**Story:**
In the city of Chelm it was extremely cold in the winter and a lot of mud accumulated in the streets. Anyone who stepped outside got covered in mud, even the king – so no one recognized him. The senior city council decided to buy the king golden shoes.

The men assumed that if people see a man with golden shoes, they will show him respect.

The king wore the golden shoes and went outside. The shoes got covered in mud, and no one treated the king with respect. The city council decided to buy the king overshoes to protect the golden shoes. The king wore the golden shoes, covered them with the overshoes and went outside. The overshoes got covered in mud and no one treated the king with respect.

The city council decided to pierce holes in the overshoes, so the gold will show.

The king went outside again, the mud got in through the holes and covered up the gold.

The city council met up again and decided to fill the holes with straw.

If you ever see a man walking around with golden shoes and pierced overshoes with straw in them – know you have seen the king of Chelm.

Did you think I'd forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had. Don't waste a breath mourning Miss Barnes. Every kitten grows up to be a cat.

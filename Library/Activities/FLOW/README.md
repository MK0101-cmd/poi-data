# FLOW - Building Blocks

This directory contains the 65 core building blocks from Flow, each designed to facilitate meaningful personal and professional development through the power of visual metaphors, stories, and structured reflection. Flow focuses on the "in-betweens" of life - the nuances between highs and lows, movement and stillness, uncertainty and clarity.

### Five Series

The Photo cards are divided into five series, each representing different aspects of life:

The moments when we express ourselves to the max - when we're open to new possibilities, have no limits, and let our creativity go wild.

#### 🌊 **In Between Series** (13 topics)  
The moments when life actually happens - the delicate moments between actions where we live in the present and enjoy the path, not just the outcome.

#### ⚡ **Conflict Series** (13 topics)
The uncomfortable moments that take us to the next level - times of disagreement, testing boundaries, and internal conflicts that lead to growth.

#### 🤝 **Belonging Series** (13 topics)
The moments when we are connected - places where we're welcome and accepted for who we are, finding our roots and authentic self.

#### 🧘 **Presence Series** (13 topics)
The moments when we allow ourselves to be - awareness of existence, being in rhythm with life, finding stillness in mind, body, and soul.

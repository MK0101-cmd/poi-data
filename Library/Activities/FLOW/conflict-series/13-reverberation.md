## Story: The Boat and the Drill

A group of people were travelling in a boat. One of them took a drill and began to drill a hole beneath himself.

His companions said to him:

"Why are you doing this?" Replied the man:

"What concern is it of yours? Am I not drilling under my own place?"

Said they to him:

"But you will flood the boat for us all!"

*Quoted in Midrash Rabbah, Vayikra 4:6*

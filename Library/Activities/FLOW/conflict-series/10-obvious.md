## Story: The Executive and the Check

A business executive was deep in debt and could see no way out. He sat on the park bench, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy. Suddenly an old man appeared before him. "I can see that something is troubling you," he said. After listening to the executive's woes, the old man said, "I believe I can help you." He wrote out a check, "Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time." The business executive saw in his hand a check for $500,000. John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world signed it! "I can erase my money worries in an instant!" he realized. Instead, the executive decided to put the un-cashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought. With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the un-cashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. "I'm so glad I caught him! He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller." Suddenly, the man realized that it wasn't the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his new-found self confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he ever imagined.

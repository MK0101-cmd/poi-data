## Story: The Two Heavens

An old man and his dog were walking along a country road, after they were actually dead. They came to a high, white stone wall along the side of the road. When they were close enough, he called out, "Excuse me, is this heaven?" "Yes, it is, Sir," a man answered. "Would you happen to have some water?" he asked. "Of course, Sir. Come right in." "I assume my friend can come in too?" he asked. "I'm sorry, Sir, but we don't accept pets." The man turned back toward the road, and continued in the direction he had been. He reached the top of another long hill.

"Excuse me!" he called. "Do you have any water?" "Certainly, there's a pump over there," a man said, pointing to a place that couldn't be seen from outside the gate. "Come on in and make yourself at home." "How about my friend here?" the traveler gestured towards the dog. "He's welcome too" he said. They walked through the gate and after the man filled the bowl for his dog, he took a long drink himself. When both were satisfied, he and the dog walked back toward the man, and asked, "What do you call this place?" "This is heaven," was the answer.

"Well, that's confusing," the traveler said. "There's another man down the road who said that place was heaven." "Nope. That's hell." "Doesn't it offend you for them to use the name of heaven like that?" "No. It actually saves us a lot of time. They screen out the people who are willing to leave their best friends behind."

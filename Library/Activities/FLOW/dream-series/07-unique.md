## Story: The Bus Stop

It was late, and Barak was in a hurry to catch the last bus home. Concerned he might miss it, he walked briskly to the bus stop. "What if I miss the bus," he thought to himself. "Where will I spend the night?"

Crossing the street, he saw a man in a wheelchair. "Excuse me, sir?" The man turned to Barak. "Can you please take me to the no. 45 bus stop?" Barak checked his watch. He had 30 seconds left. Pondering for a second, he knew there was no other way. He began wheeling the man toward the bus stop as he saw the bus approaching. "Run to it." said the man. Barak ran to the bus. Catching the bus and his breath, he said to the driver, "Please wait a moment, a man in a wheelchair needs to get on as well." The mustached driver looked at Barak and said, "I'm not waiting for anyone. Do you want to get on?" Barak looked back. The man in the wheelchair signaled, suggesting he should get on the bus. "No. I'm not leaving him behind." The driver, not giving it another thought, closed the doors and drove off. Barak walked back to the man in a wheelchair. Not knowing what to do, he pushed the chair around the bus stop. Out of nowhere, another bus appeared from down the road. "Do you want to hop on?" the driver asked. "Of course!" replied Barak, delighted. "I thought the other bus was the last for the night." "I thought so too, until I saw you from my window," said the driver. "Then, I realized that it was not the last, because I came to pick up those who care."

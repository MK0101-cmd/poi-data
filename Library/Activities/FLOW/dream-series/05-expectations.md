## Story: The Cat Story

The other night I was talking to an extremely wise man. We spoke about love, about disappointments, and also about cats. I told him that what I like most and admire about cats – and a little bit about myself too – is that no matter how deep their fall is – they always land on their feet, flash their arrogantly indifferent feline smile, and keep going as if nothing happened, nobody fell down – especially not them.

This very wise man was silent for a moment, and then he told me that I've got it all wrong: cats only act as if they are not hurt. True, they always land on their feet – but in fact, they hit their back and shatter to pieces every single time. Nonetheless, cats being cats, are aware of their image, and they know they are expected to land on their feet every single time, so they hide the truth from everyone.

Thankfully, the man could not see my face that night. Otherwise he would have been able to see my eyes and to see that I was shattered to pieces, scattered across the floor.

## Story: The Parrot Joke

Once a man went to buy a parrot. Man: These parrots seem nice, but show me the best and healthy ones. Shopkeeper: Sure sir, I have three best parrots. Soon the shopkeeper brought those three parrots. Man: How much does each one of them cost? Shopkeeper: The first parrot costs $1,000, the second parrot costs $2,000, and the third parrot costs $5,000. Man: That's interesting, but why are they so expensive? Shopkeeper: The first parrot can speak many languages and even knows about the Windows operating system. Man: Wow. What about the second parrot? Shopkeeper: Well, he also knows many languages, plus he knows some things about Windows and the Linux operating systems. Man: That's amazing! What about the third one? Why does he cost $5,000? Which languages does he know? Shopkeeper: Well, frankly speaking, he just fires bad words and doesn't know anything, but the other two parrots call him BOSS!

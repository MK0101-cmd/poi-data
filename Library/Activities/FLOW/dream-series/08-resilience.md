## Story: The Young King and the Sheep

A few months into the reign of a young king troubles began; drought, diseases and an enemy conquest, killing and imprisoning many. The young king escaped and sought refuge in a neighboring state where his friend was the ruler. I must have bad luck, he thought, I lost everything, this never happened in my family.

When he reached his friend, he asked for help. After careful thought his friend offered him a herd of 100 sheep. The young king scoffed at this "friendly" attitude. He had hoped for much more, he was a king not a shepherd, but still he accepted the offer.

Not much time passed and his herd was attacked by wolves. He ran away while his sheep got killed. He returned to his friend to ask for another favor. This time he received only 50 sheep. Again, his herd got killed and again, he received help but only 25 sheep. The young king got worried, if something happened again, the number would be halved again. He started taking care of his herd, it's conditions and safety. He even started talking to his sheep. In no time the herd grew to 1000 sheep.

Delighted with this, he returned to his friend who was very happy with the news and offered him a whole state to rule. The young king, who by now was disillusioned with his friend, asked him "Why didn't you give me a state right away if you had one too?" The friend responded. "Well, since I have seen what has happened with your kingdom I was waiting for you to learn how to manage and lead others."

# FLOW Layout Processes Guide

## Overview

The FLOW toolkit includes four distinct layout processes designed to guide you through different types of personal exploration and growth. Each process uses 3 Photo cards with specific questions to create a structured yet intuitive experience.

## The Four Layout Processes

### 1. Check Up
**Purpose:** Self-assessment and alignment check
**Best for:** Regular self-reflection, course correction, staying on track
**Key Question:** "Am I in alignment with where I'm heading?"

### 2. Making a Shift
**Purpose:** Navigating change and transformation
**Best for:** Feeling stuck, major life changes, seeking direction
**Key Question:** "What inner strengths will help me take my next big leap?"

### 3. What Do I Want?
**Purpose:** Clarifying desires and building commitment
**Best for:** Goal setting, decision making, reconnecting with authentic self
**Key Question:** "What does my inner voice truly desire?"

### 4. Finally
**Purpose:** Creating closure and moving forward
**Best for:** Endings, transitions, letting go, new beginnings
**Key Question:** "What door needs to be closed so I can move forward?"

## How to Use Layout Processes

### Method A: Guided Process
1. Choose the process that matches your current need
2. Select your issue or question to explore
3. Place the 3 Layout cards face up
4. Choose 3 Photo cards (face up or face down)
5. Place one Photo card next to each Layout question
6. Work through each question systematically
7. Look for connections between all three cards
8. Record insights and plan actions

### Method B: Mix & Match
1. Choose 3-5 Layout cards intuitively (face up or face down)
2. Select 3-5 Photo cards to match
3. Use the Blank Layout cards for custom questions
4. Follow the same process as Method A
5. Let your intuition guide the sequence

## Working with Cards

### Face Up vs Face Down
- **Face Up:** Allows you to observe your selection process and make conscious choices
- **Face Down:** Adds surprise and mystery, letting go of control and expectation

### Card Selection Tips
- Trust your first instinct
- Don't overthink your choices
- Notice which series the cards come from
- Pay attention to your emotional response
- Let the cards "call" to you

## Integration and Follow-up

### After Each Process
1. Take a photo of your layout
2. Record key insights on the Focus card
3. Write down specific actions you'll take
4. Set a timeline for follow-up
5. Share your process with someone if helpful

### Deepening Your Practice
- Use the inspirational book to expand on card topics
- Try the same process with different cards
- Combine processes for complex issues
- Use regularly for ongoing self-reflection
- Experiment with different card orientations

## Tips for Success

- Create a quiet, uninterrupted space
- Set an intention before beginning
- Be open to unexpected insights
- Don't judge your responses
- Trust the process
- Allow time for integration

### Finally

- At natural ending points (year-end, etc.)

## Combining Processes

You can combine multiple processes for deeper exploration:
- Start with "Check Up" to assess current state
- Use "What Do I Want?" to clarify desires
- Apply "Making a Shift" to plan changes
- End with "Finally" to close old chapters

## Customization

- Use Blank Layout cards for personal questions
- Create your own process sequences
- Adapt questions to your specific needs
- Combine with other Points of YouÂ® tools
- Develop your own rituals and practices

Remember: There are no right or wrong answers. The power is in your interpretation, intuition, and willingness to explore.

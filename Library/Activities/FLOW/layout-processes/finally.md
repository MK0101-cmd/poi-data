# Finally

## Overview

Use this process when you are looking for closure. Take time to reflect on a journey, a year, a project, a venture or a relationship that has come to an end. Close the door that needs to be closed and move forward.

## Purpose

This layout process is designed to help you:
- Acknowledge what has ended or needs to end
- Honor the journey and lessons learned
- Release what no longer serves you
- Create space for new beginnings
- Find peace with closure

## Process Steps

### 1. Preparation
- Identify what you want to bring closure to
- Write it down on the Focus card
- Create a sacred, reflective space
- Light a candle or create a ritual to mark this moment

### 2. Card Selection
- Spread the Photo cards face up or face down
- Choose 3 Photo cards that speak to your ending
- Let your intuition guide you to the right cards
- Place one card next to each Layout card question

### 3. Layout Questions
Use these three guiding questions with your selected cards:

**Question 1: What am I ready to let go of?**
- Observe the first card with acceptance
- What does the image and word tell you about what needs to end?
- What patterns, beliefs, or situations are you ready to release?
- What has served its purpose and can now be released?

**Question 2: What have I learned from this journey?**
- Look at the second card with gratitude
- What wisdom and lessons does this card represent?
- What growth and insights have you gained?
- What gifts has this experience given you?

**Question 3: What new space am I creating?**
- Examine the third card with hope
- What possibilities does this card suggest for your future?
- What new energy or direction is emerging?
- What door is opening as another closes?

### 4. Integration and Release
- Look at all three cards together
- Notice the complete story they tell about your ending
- How do they connect to your original situation?
- What final insights emerge?

### 5. Closure Ritual
- Record your most significant insights on the Focus card
- Write a letter of gratitude to what you're releasing
- Create a symbolic act of closure (burn the letter, plant something, etc.)
- Set an intention for what you're opening to

## Tips for Success

- Allow yourself to feel all emotions - grief, relief, gratitude
- Don't rush the process - closure takes time
- Be gentle with yourself during this transition
- Focus on what you're gaining, not just what you're losing

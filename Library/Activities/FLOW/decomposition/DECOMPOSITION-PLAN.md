## Implementation Strategy

### **Batch Processing Approach**
1. **Extract all content first** - Get all stories, quotes, questions in one pass
2. **Create files in batches** - Work through one series at a time
3. **Review and refine** - Quality check each batch before moving on
4. **Final integration** - Update all cross-references and master index

### **Quality Control Checkpoints**
- After each series completion
- After layout processes completion
- After implementation guides
- Final comprehensive review

This plan ensures systematic, efficient completion of the FLOW decomposition while maintaining high quality and consistency throughout the process.

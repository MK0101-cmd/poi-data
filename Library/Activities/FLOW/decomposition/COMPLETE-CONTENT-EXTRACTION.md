### 2. Hunger (Lines 213-268)
**Story**: The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle
On Saturday, he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. That night he had a stomach ache. The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one nice leaf, and after that, he felt better. Now he wasn't hungry anymore-and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore. He was a big fat caterpillar. He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself. He stayed inside for more than two weeks. Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and... He became a beautiful butterfly!

### 5. Expectations (Lines 361-396)
**Story**: Cat Story by Vered Mosenzon
The other night I was talking to an extremely wise man. We spoke about love, about disappointments, and also about cats. I told him that what I like most and admire about cats – and a little bit about myself too – is that no matter how deep their fall is – they always land on their feet, flash their arrogantly indifferent feline smile, and keep going as if nothing happened, nobody fell down – especially not them. This very wise man was silent for a moment, and then he told me that I've got it all wrong: cats only act as if they are not hurt. True, they always land on their feet – but in fact, they hit their back and shatter to pieces every single time. Nonetheless, cats being cats, are aware of their image, and they know they are expected to land on their feet every single time, so they hide the truth from everyone. Thankfully, the man could not see my face that night. Otherwise he would have been able to see my eyes and to see that I was shattered to pieces, scattered across the floor.

**Questions**:

- What are my expectations towards myself? How can I be less disappointed?

### 6. Intention (Lines 397-442)
**Story**: Dancing in the Rain by Katy Who, Seasons of Magic
The promise of sunlight. But there is only rain. The promise of warmth. But there is only coldness. The promise of laughter. But there is only silence. Rain pours, storms roar, Rivers run wild, Sandals stay in and raincoats come out. This is July, and the inevitable summer washout days are here. The ones with the power to dampen even the brightest of spirits. But we can fight the feelings it forces us to feel. We can make the most out of the rainy days and wait for the flurry of wildflowers. And while we wait, Dancing in the rain is never a bad idea.

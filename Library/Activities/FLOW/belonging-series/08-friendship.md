## Story: The Two Survivors

A voyaging ship was wrecked during a storm at sea and only two of the men were able to swim to a small, desert-like island. The two survivors who have been good friends, not knowing what else to do, agreed that they had no other recourse but to pray to God. However, to see whose prayer was more powerful, they agreed to divide the territory between them and stay on opposite sides of the island.

The first man prayed for food, a house, clothes and a wife. The next day, like magic, all of these were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.

Then, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife could leave the island. In the morning, he found a ship docked at his side of the island. The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to leave the second man on the island. He considered the other man unworthy to receive God's blessings, since none of his prayers had been answered. As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from heaven booming, "Why are you leaving your companion on the island?"

"My blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them," the first man answered. "His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not deserve anything."

"You are mistaken!" the voice rebuked. "He had only one prayer, which I answered. He prayed that all your prayers be answered."

"I don't need very much now," said the boy, "just a quiet place to sit and rest. I am very tired."

"Well," said the tree, Straightening herself up as she could, "well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting. Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest." And the boy did.

*Shel Silverstein, The giving tree*

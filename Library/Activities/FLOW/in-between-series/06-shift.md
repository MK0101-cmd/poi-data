## Story: The Thief and the Monk

One evening as Shichiri Kojun was reciting sutras, a thief with a sharp sword entered, demanding either his money or his life.

Shichiri told him: 'Do not disturb me. You can find the money in that drawer.' Then he resumed his recitation. A little while afterwards he stopped and called: 'Don't take it all. I need some to pay taxes tomorrow.' The intruder gathered up most of the money and started to leave. 'Thank a person when you receive a gift,' Shichiri added.

The man thanked him and made off. A few days afterwards the fellow was caught and confessed, among others, to the offense against Shichiri. When Shichiri was called in as a witness he said: 'This man is no thief, at least as far as I am concerned. I gave him the money and he thanked me for it.' After the man finished his prison term, he went to Shichiri and became his disciple.

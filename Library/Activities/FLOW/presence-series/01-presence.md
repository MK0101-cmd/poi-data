## Story: The Zen Master's Practice

Someone asked a Zen Master, "How do you practice Zen?"

The master said,

"When you are hungry, eat; when you are tired, sleep."

"Isn't that what everyone does anyway?" The master replied,

"No, no. Most people entertain a thousand desires while they eat and scheme over a thousand plans while they sleep."

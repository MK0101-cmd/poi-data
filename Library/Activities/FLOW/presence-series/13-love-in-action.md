# Love in Action

## Story

Once upon a time, there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to write. One day, as he was walking along the shore, he noticed a young man who was reaching down to the shore, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean.

He came closer and called out "Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?" The young man paused, looked up, and replied "Throwing starfish into the ocean." "I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?" asked the somewhat startled wise man. To this, the young man replied, "The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them in, they'll die." Upon hearing this, the wise man commented, "But, young man, do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can't possibly make a difference!"

At this, the young man bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it met the water, he said,

"I made a difference for that one."

Loren C. Eiseley, Adapted from The Star Thrower

## Quotes

When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object.

Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness of Being

Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams.

Being in love, rather than giving or taking love, is the only thing that provides stability. Being in love means seeing the Beloved all around me.

I think we love differently every day. Like the guy who said you can't stand in a river at exactly the same place twice. Today I love you differently than yesterday, or will tomorrow.

Jonathan Carroll

One small action of love can do far,

far more for a soul than all the most beautiful words in the world.

Eileen Caddy

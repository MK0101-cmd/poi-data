## The Warrior's Ships

A long while ago, a great warrior faced a situation which made it necessary for him to make a decision which insured his success on the battlefield. He was about to send his armies against a powerful enemy whose men outnumbered his own.

He loaded his soldiers into boats, sailed to the enemy's country, unloaded soldiers and equipment, and then gave the order to burn the ships that had carried them.

Addressing his men before the first battle, he said, 'You see the boats going up in smoke. That means that we cannot leave these shores alive unless we win! We now have no choice -- we win or we perish!'

They won.

Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat.

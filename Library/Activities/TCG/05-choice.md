## African Folk Tale
There was once a truly beautiful bird -- strong, free and very brave. Nothing at all frightened it. It would fly wherever it chose to and was very proud of its very colorful and vibrant plumage.

One day, the bird decided to settle down and build a nest for itself. And so, one by one, it began to pluck out its feathers and to use them to build a beautiful nest, one that was comfortable and gave the bird a true sense of security.

And the bird was happy!

But it could no longer fly.

## Reflection Questions

- **Just how much is free choice and how much is pre-determined?**

## Common Responses

### Avoiding Choice
- I have no choice. I have to. It's not up to me. I made my choice; now I am relieved. Everything is clear now.
- I cannot change. Staying on both sides of the fence.
- I don't know what is right for me. I prefer to wait for something to happen. What if I go wrong? Tomorrow. Another time. It'll work out...

### Embracing Choice
- I have chosen to be devoted and it's a weight off my mind. I am too calculated. And what about me? I am ready to take the plunge. You can lose control.
- Que sera, sera. Such excitement. It's every day anew. When I dedicate myself to something, I forget about me.

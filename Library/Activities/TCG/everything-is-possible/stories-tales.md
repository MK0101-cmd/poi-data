## Walt Disney's Dream

"Lacking a creative sense" and "no original ideas" Those were the reasons for turning him down, the young artist was told, when he applied for a job as an illustrator at a newspaper. But the young artist was blessed with a sense of confidence unlike those around him.

He believed that creating an entire fantasy world based on illustrated characters creating them in larger than life-size, illuminating it all in the most colorful bright lights, would make people forget their problems, become child-like once again and thus reconnect to their dreams.

The name of the young artist was Walt Disney, who went on to build the incredible Disney Empire.

The early 1900s were undoubtedly not the times to realistically believe in the creation of an entire fantasy world. No one other than Disney himself, believed it would bring such joy to so many children and adults around the world. His optimism changed reality for us all.

Hundreds of millions of people from all around the globe have grown up with the magical world of Walt Disney -- a world that began with the dream of a single individual.

**"If you can dream it, you can achieve it"** would be the creed that guided Disney throughout his enterprise.

# Key Quotes - Solutions

## Core Philosophy

> Your approach to problems, determines whether you will or will not find a solution to them. One approach has it that all problems are catastrophes, while another says that no problem is too great. The moment you say no problem is too great, 99% of the problem have disappeared, and your entire perspective of it has changed.

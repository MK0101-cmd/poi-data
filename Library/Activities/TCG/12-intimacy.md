## The Smile Story
I was to be killed. I searched my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes which had escaped their search. I found one but I had no matches. I looked through the bars at my jailer.

He looked at me, shrugged and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the match, his eyes inadvertently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that.

In that instant, a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn't want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly and smiling. I kept smiling at him, now aware of him as a person and not just a jailer. And his looking at me seemed to have a new dimension, too. 'Do you have children?' he asked. 'Yes.' I took out my wallet and fumbled for the pictures of my family.

Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell and silently led me out...

### Intimacy Challenges
- We haven't spoken at all in almost a month. I had a really great time with her yesterday, and without sex. There's a wall between us. I feel she is a part of me. I can't get close to him. He is my best friend.
- If there is no intimacy between us, what's left? I soar with him. I enjoy talking to me

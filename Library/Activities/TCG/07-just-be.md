## Zen Story
A happy-go-lucky centipede lived a quiet and peaceful life out in the jungle, without a care in the world -- until, that is, a philosophical frog approached it one day and asked it a strange question:

"What is the order you move your legs in when you walk?" the frog asked. "How does a centipede decide which leg to move first and which leg to move next? And with one hundred of them to choose from to boot!"

Coping with 100 legs seemed to the frog to be a big problem, and it was most eager to solve the puzzle. The centipede, for its part, was somewhat surprised and unsure:

"This is how I have walked all my life, and I have never asked myself that question. Let me think about it," it said, standing still for a few moments and quietly thinking about the answer.

"Hmmm," it thought to itself, "the frog is quite right: Which leg do I move first?"

The centipede then tried to take a step forward; but ...oops! Its legs got tangled up and it fell over.

It then turned to the frog and said: "Pleeeeease! My dear frog, don't ever ask that same question of another centipede; I have walked without any problems my entire life, and now ... I cannot move!"

### Resistance to Being

## Personal Story
I have a friend who lives in a very well to do neighborhood. Both she and her husband are successful lawyers; they are two intelligent individuals and each hold prestigious university degrees.

I had been at their home for about an hour or so during a recent visit when my friend told me that she had to leave for a few minutes to pick up her daughter from a dance class. When the two of them returned, the young girl was sobbing and clearly very upset.

I asked my friend what had happened to bring on such crying, and she replied:

"I always wanted to be a dancer and my parents wouldn't hear of it. The same thing is not going to happen to my daughter. She has to be a dancer -- even if it is tough on her. I missed out big time because my parents forced me to become a lawyer. I will never force her to be a lawyer -- she'll be a dancer!"

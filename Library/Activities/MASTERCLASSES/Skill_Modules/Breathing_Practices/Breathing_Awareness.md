### Practice

## Increasing Oxygen Level

### Three Key Principles

#### 1. Light Breathing
- **Purpose**: Gentle, effortless breathing
- **Practice**: Breathe as if you're sleeping
- **Focus**: Soft, natural rhythm
- **Benefit**: Calms nervous system

#### 2. Slow Breathing
- **Purpose**: Extended exhale, relaxed pace
- **Practice**: Count to 4 on inhale, 6 on exhale
- **Focus**: Longer exhale than inhale
- **Benefit**: Activates parasympathetic nervous system

#### 3. Deep Breathing
- **Purpose**: Full lung capacity, complete breath
- **Practice**: Breathe into belly, ribs, chest
- **Focus**: Three-part breath (belly, ribs, chest)
- **Benefit**: Maximum oxygen intake

## What is Supervision?

### Definition
- **Supervision**: Interaction where a coach brings experiences to a supervisor
- **Purpose**: Reflective dialogue, collaborative learning, support
- **Benefits**: Enhances coach's wellbeing, supports client and organisation development

### Functions of Supervision
1. **Developmental Function**: Develop skills, understanding, capacity
2. **Resourcing Function**: Supportive space to process client work
3. **Qualitative Function**: Concerned with quality, standards, ethical integrity

## Psychological Mechanisms

### Projection
- **Definition**: Defence mechanism where ego denies impulses by attributing them to others
- **Example**: Bully projects vulnerability onto the target; confused person projects confusion onto others
- **Freud's view**: Not arbitrary; exaggerates traits already present in the other person

### Transference
- **Definition**: Redirecting emotions/feelings (often unconsciously) from one person to another
- **In therapy**: Patient projects feelings toward another individual onto the therapist
- **Patterns**: Often linked to relationships from childhood

### Countertransference
- **Definition**: Occurs when the therapist transfers emotions to the client
- **Nature**: Typically a reaction to transference
- **Importance**: Can provide valuable information about client dynamics

### Parallel Process
- **Definition**: Phenomenon between coach and supervisor
- **Process**: Coach mirrors client's problems in the relationship with supervisor
- **Mechanism**: Client's transference + coach's countertransference reappear in coach/supervisor relationship

## The Seven-Eyed Model

### Eye 1: Client Focus
- **Focus**: Coachee's situation, issues, choices
- **Questions**: What is the client presenting? What are their challenges?
- **Purpose**: Understand client's world and perspective
- **Application**: Direct attention to client's needs and goals

### Eye 2: Interventions Focus
- **Focus**: Strategies/interventions used by coach
- **Questions**: Why/how were interventions made? What alternatives exist?
- **Purpose**: Examine coaching techniques and approaches
- **Application**: Review and improve coaching methods

### Eye 3: Relationship Focus (Client–Coach)
- **Focus**: Explore conscious/unconscious dynamics in the coaching relationship
- **Questions**: What's happening between coach and client? What patterns emerge?
- **Purpose**: Understand relationship dynamics and transference
- **Application**: Work with relationship issues and patterns

### Eye 4: Focus on the Coach (Supervisee)
- **Focus**: Coach's own experience as an instrument for understanding the coachee system
- **Questions**: What is the coach experiencing? How is the coach being affected?
- **Purpose**: Use coach's experience as information about client
- **Application**: Develop coach's self-awareness and intuition

### Eye 5: Focus on Supervisory Relationship
- **Focus**: How coach's absorption of coachee system plays out with supervisor
- **Questions**: What's happening between coach and supervisor? What patterns emerge?
- **Purpose**: Understand parallel process and transference
- **Application**: Work with supervision relationship dynamics

### Eye 6: Supervisor's Process
- **Focus**: Supervisor's here-and-now experience with coach to reflect on client dynamics
- **Questions**: What is the supervisor experiencing? How is the supervisor being affected?
- **Purpose**: Use supervisor's experience as information about client
- **Application**: Develop supervisor's awareness and intuition

### Eye 7: Wider Contexts
- **Focus**: Organisational, social, cultural, ethical, contractual contexts of supervision
- **Questions**: What broader factors are influencing the work? What systems are at play?
- **Purpose**: Understand systemic influences and contexts
- **Application**: Address organizational and cultural factors

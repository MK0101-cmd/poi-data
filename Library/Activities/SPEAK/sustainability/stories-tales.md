# Stories & Tales - Sustainability

## The Forest Steward

In a small village, there was an old man who was known as the Forest Steward. Every day, he would walk through the forest, tending to the trees and plants, and teaching the children about the importance of caring for the environment.

One day, a young man asked him, "Why do you spend so much time caring for trees that you will never see grow to their full height? You're old, and these trees will take decades to mature."

The Forest Steward smiled and replied, "I care for these trees not for myself, but for my children and grandchildren. I want them to inherit a forest that is healthy and thriving, just as my ancestors left for me. The trees I plant today will provide shade, clean air, and beauty for generations to come."

He continued, "Sustainability is not about what we can get today, but about what we can leave for tomorrow. It's about thinking beyond ourselves and considering the impact of our actions on future generations."

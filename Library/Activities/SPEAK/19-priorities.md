## Story: The Zen Master and the Jar

Once there was a wise Zen master who had many students. One day, a student approached him and asked, "Master, how can I learn to prioritize my time and focus on what truly matters?" The Zen master paused for a moment and then said, "Let me show you." He took out a glass jar and placed it on the table in front of the student. Then, he took a pile of large rocks and began to place them inside the jar until it was full.

"Is the jar full?" he asked the student. "Yes, Master," the student replied.

The Zen master then took out a bag of smaller stones and poured them into the jar. The smaller stones filled the spaces between the large rocks until they reached the top of the jar.

"Is the jar full now?" he asked.

The student hesitated before answering, but then said, "Yes, Master."

The Zen master then took out a bag of sand and poured it into the jar. The sand filled the tiny spaces between the large rocks and the small stones until the jar was completely full.

"Now, is the jar full?" he asked again.

The student, understanding the lesson, replied, "No, Master. There is still room for more." The Zen master smiled and said, "Exactly. The large rocks represent the most important things in your life, such as your family, your health, and your passions. The small stones represent the smaller, but still important things, like your job and your responsibilities. And the sand represents the little things in life that can easily fill up your time and distract you from what truly matters."

He continued, "If you fill your jar with the sand first, you will have no room for the larger rocks and small stones. But if you prioritize the important things first, then the rest will fall into place. Remember to always focus on what truly matters and prioritize your time accordingly."

# Stories & Tales - Mistakes

## The Post-it Note Invention

In 1968, Dr. Spencer Silver, a chemist at 3M, was trying to create a super-strong adhesive. Instead, he accidentally created a weak adhesive that could be easily removed. This was considered a failure - the adhesive wasn't strong enough for its intended purpose.

For years, Silver tried to find a use for this "failed" adhesive, but no one was interested. Then, in 1974, his colleague Art Fry had an idea. Fry was frustrated because the bookmarks in his hymn book kept falling out. He remembered Silver's weak adhesive and thought it might be perfect for creating removable bookmarks.

Together, they developed the Post-it Note, which became one of 3M's most successful products. What started as a mistake - a weak adhesive that was considered a failure - became a revolutionary product that changed how people organize and communicate.

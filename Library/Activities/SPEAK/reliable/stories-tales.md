# Stories & Tales - Reliable

## The Lighthouse Keeper

In a small coastal town, there was a lighthouse keeper named Thomas who had been tending the lighthouse for over 30 years. Every night, without fail, he would climb the spiral staircase to the top of the lighthouse and light the beacon that guided ships safely to shore.

One stormy night, when the winds were howling and the waves were crashing against the rocks, Thomas's family begged him not to go to the lighthouse. "It's too dangerous," they said. "The ships can manage without the light for one night."

But Thomas shook his head. "The ships are counting on me," he said. "I've never missed a night in 30 years, and I won't start now. The sailors depend on that light to find their way home safely."

Despite the danger, Thomas made his way to the lighthouse through the storm. He lit the beacon as he had done every night for three decades. The light shone through the darkness, guiding ships safely to shore, just as it had done for thousands of nights before.

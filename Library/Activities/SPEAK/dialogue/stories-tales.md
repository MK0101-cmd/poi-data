## Urban Tale: The Man and the Dog

A man was sitting in a public garden, peacefully, holding a dog on a leash, dozing at his feet. A lady approaches, sits down next to him, looks at the dog for a moment and asks the man:

"Is your dog nice?"

"He is very nice," the man replies.

The woman reaches out her hand to the dog, but it suddenly stands up and bites her ferociously.

"What did you say to me?" asks the woman, furious and bleeding. "You told me your dog was nice!"

"Mine is. That one is my sister's dog."

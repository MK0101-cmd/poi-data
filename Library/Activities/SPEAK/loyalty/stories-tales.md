# Stories & Tales - Loyalty

## The Loyal Dog

In a small town, there was a dog named Hachiko who belonged to a professor. Every day, Hachiko would accompany the professor to the train station in the morning and wait for him to return in the evening. This routine continued for years, and the townspeople came to know and love the faithful dog.

One day, the professor suffered a stroke and died while at work. Hachiko, unaware of what had happened, continued to go to the train station every day at the same time, waiting for his master to return. He waited there for nine years, until his own death, never giving up hope that his beloved master would come back.

The townspeople were so moved by Hachiko's loyalty that they erected a statue in his honor at the train station. To this day, the statue stands as a symbol of unwavering loyalty and devotion.

# Stories & Tales - Time Out

## The Resting Warrior

In a ancient kingdom, there was a great warrior who was known for his strength and courage in battle. He had never been defeated and was revered by all. However, he was also known for his relentless training and never taking breaks, even when he was exhausted.

One day, after a particularly grueling battle, the warrior was so tired that he could barely stand. His advisor approached him and said, "My lord, you must rest. Even the strongest warrior needs time to recover and reflect."

The warrior replied, "I cannot rest. There are always enemies to fight and battles to win. If I rest, I will become weak and vulnerable."

The advisor smiled and said, "A warrior who never rests becomes a warrior who cannot fight. Rest is not weakness - it is wisdom. It is what makes you strong enough to face the next battle."

The warrior finally listened and took a much-needed rest. When he returned to battle, he was stronger, more focused, and more effective than ever before. He learned that true strength comes not from constant action, but from the wisdom of knowing when to rest.

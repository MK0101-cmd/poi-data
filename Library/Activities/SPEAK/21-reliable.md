## Story: The Cicada and the Ant

The cicada, having sung All summer long,

Found herself sorely deprived When the north wind arrived:

Not a single morsel Of fly or tiny worm.

She went to plead famine

At the house of the Ant, her neighbor, Praying her to lend her

Some grain to survive Until the new season.

"I will pay you," she said to her,

"Before August, on my honor as an animal, Interest and principal."

The Ant is not a lender:

That is the least of her faults.

"What were you doing in warm weather?" She said to this borrower.

"Night and day to all that came I sang, if you please."

"You sang? I am very glad. Well! Dance now."

**Jean de la Fontaine - The Cicada and the Ant**

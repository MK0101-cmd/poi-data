# Stories & Tales - Diversity

## King Ahmaq and the Mirror

When King Ahmaq ascended the throne, he received a mirror as a gift. At that time, no one - even the king - had ever seen a mirror. So the king looked at his own image. He found himself so beautiful that he decreed that all the men in the city should henceforth dress like him, wear the same beard as him, and speak with the same voice as him. He added that anyone who did not obey would be punished by death.

Soon there were only men in the city who followed the king's example. Some time later, a terrible plague fell on the city. The frightened Ahmaq called upon God, who came down to the city.

But God did not find Ahmaq.

All men were alike.

So God left, abandoning the city, its inhabitants and Ahmaq, its king, to their sad fate. Thus disappeared this city that had once been so beautiful.

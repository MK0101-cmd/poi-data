## Story: The Discovery of Penicillin

Laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London. After returning from a summer vacation, he noticed that a petri dish containing Staphylococcus bacteria had been contaminated with a mold called Penicillium notatum. Instead of discarding the dish, he decided to take a closer look.

Upon examining the dish, Fleming observed that the area around the mold was free of bacteria. This chance discovery sparked his curiosity, and he began to investigate further. He grew more Penicillium and found that it had a remarkable ability to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.

This discovery eventually led to the development of penicillin, one of the world's first antibiotics, and a turning point in the treatment of infectious diseases.

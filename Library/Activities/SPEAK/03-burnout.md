## Personal Story

I'd hit a wall. I was physically and emotionally burned out. I'd been working 80 to 100-hour weeks for years. At one point, I think I was averaging maybe four hours of sleep a night. I was living off of fast food and caffeine. I'd stopped exercising. I wasn't making time for friends or family.

Eventually, I realized that I needed to make a change. I couldn't keep going at that pace forever. So I started to prioritize self-care. I began exercising again. I made time for people I cared about. I started sleeping more. I even started meditating.

It wasn't easy to break out of those old patterns, but it was necessary. And in the end, it made me a better leader. I had more energy and focus. I was able to approach challenges with a clearer mind. And I was happier. I realized that taking care of myself wasn't just important for my own well-being â€“ it was essential for the well-being of the company as a whole.

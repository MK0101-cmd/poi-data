# The Interaction Schema

## Overview

The interaction schema serves as a guide to protect and facilitate effective communication, ensuring that the message is delivered clearly. Making mistakes is acceptable as long as they occur within the boundaries of the interaction schema.

## The Process

### Step 1: Trainer Delivers Message
- Deliver a message, statement, or question
- Be clear and intentional about what you want to communicate
- Use appropriate tone and body language

### Step 2: Participant Responds
- Participant responds with their reaction
- This could be:
  - A question
  - Acceptance
  - Sharing
  - Opposition
  - Resistance

### Step 3: Trainer Asks "Do I Understand?"
- **No:** Ask, be curious, involved
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Show genuine interest
  - Dig deeper into their response
- **Yes:** Ask "Is it relevant?"
  - **No:** Use cutter (redirect or stop the conversation)
  - **Yes:** Respond with question/content/turn the question with the group

## Key Guidelines

### Stay Within the Schema
- **Don't Pretend to Know:** If you don't know the answer, don't feel compelled to provide one
- **Avoid Self-Righteousness:** Don't shift focus to yourself
- **Remember:** It's not about you

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Pretending to Know:** Losing humility and becoming arrogant
- **Premature Answers:** Answering before it's the right time
- **Focusing on Self:** Making it about you instead of the participant

### Best Practices
- **Active Listening:** Remain in a state of active listening when it's someone else's turn
- **Verbal and Image-based:** Focus on these interventions as central to practice
- **Grounding Tool:** When in doubt, return to the participant's card, photo, or image
- **Permission:** Always ask for permission before engaging in any intervention

## The Schema in Action

### Example 1: Clear Understanding
**Trainer:** "How do you feel about the team's current communication?"
**Participant:** "I think we're doing okay, but sometimes people don't listen."
**Trainer:** "Do I understand? Yes. Is it relevant? Yes. What specific situations make you feel like people aren't listening?"

### Example 2: Need for Clarification
**Trainer:** "What challenges are you facing in your role?"
**Participant:** "It's complicated."
**Trainer:** "Do I understand? No. Can you help me understand what makes it complicated?"

### Example 3: Not Relevant
**Trainer:** "How can we improve our team collaboration?"
**Participant:** "I had a great weekend with my family."
**Trainer:** "Do I understand? Yes. Is it relevant? No. [Use cutter] Let's focus on the team collaboration question."

## Using Cutters

### When to Use Cutters
- When the response is not relevant to the current topic
- When someone is dominating the conversation
- When the discussion is going off track
- When time is limited

### Types of Cutters
- **Light/Friendly:** Subtle redirections that participants often don't notice
- **Medium:** More noticeable but still executed gently
- **Killer:** Most direct, used when necessary, should be done respectfully

### Examples of Cutters
- "That's interesting, but let's focus on..."
- "I hear you, and I'd like to bring us back to..."
- "Thank you for sharing, now let's consider..."

## Benefits of the Schema

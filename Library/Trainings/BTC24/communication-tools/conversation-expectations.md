## Example

"Before we begin, I would like to share what's important to me in our conversation to ensure its success:

1. **Precision:** I aim to provide precise data and inputs for our discussion. I've prepared thoroughly, but if I discover any missing information during our meeting, I won't make assumptions or provide incomplete details. Instead, I'll commit to checking thoroughly after our meeting and providing you with solid input.

2. **Integrity:** My priority is our mutual success and achieving our goals. If I have something crucial to contribute, even if it may be confronting or unconventional, I'm committed to sharing it authentically and straightforwardly. I value open and honest communication. I expect the same for you and I'm willing to receive any feedback.

Is this approach acceptable to you? Now, I'd like to hear from you. Do you have anything to add regarding what's important for you in our conversation?"

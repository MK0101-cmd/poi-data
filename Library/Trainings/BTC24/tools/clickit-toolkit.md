# ClicKit Toolkit

## Overview

Transform your trainings into dynamic learning experiences with our versatile participant kits. ClicKit is designed to enhance both participant engagement and facilitator effectiveness. It's an essential tool for boosting interaction, critical thinking, and collaboration.

## Contents

Each ClicKit includes:

- **An inspiring journal** - Personal reflection and note-taking
- **A pen** - For writing and creative expression
- **12 engaging Photo cards** - Visual stimuli for discussion
- **8 insightful Question cards** - Guided inquiry prompts
- **Creative stickers and sticky notes** - Interactive elements
- **A canvas for visual explorations** - Space for creative work

## Workshop in a Box

ClicKit serves as your "Workshop in a Box". It is crafted to meet the demands of modern organizational training, providing a flexible toolkit for any theme, objective, or audience.

## Certificate Generation

### QR Code Feedback System
After completing your training, invite your participants to scan the QR code on the ClicKit canvas. They can provide brief, anonymous feedback and receive an official certificate from Points of You®, with your name on it, that they can easily share on LinkedIn.

### Trainer ID
You'll receive your unique Trainer ID after the first session, which you can share with your participants to help them obtain their certificate. Once feedback is submitted, you'll be notified immediately.

### Professional Certifications
After becoming certified, you'll be able to issue various certificates for our official trainings, some of which include ICF CCEUs and/or SHRM PDCs.

## Certification Requirements

**Important Note:** As part of your certification process, you must receive feedback from at least 18 participants you've used ClicKit with, submitted through the QR code, by the beginning of the second stage of the program. You can achieve this with one group of 18 participants, smaller groups, or even through one-on-one sessions - it's entirely up to you.

## Integration with Training

ClicKit is designed to work seamlessly with the Points of You® methodology:

- **Pause** - Journal reflection and visual exploration
- **Expand** - Photo card discussions and perspective sharing
- **Focus** - Question card guided inquiry
- **Doing** - Canvas-based action planning

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Pre-Training Setup** - Ensure each participant receives their own ClicKit
2. **During Training** - Guide participants through structured activities
3. **Post-Training** - Encourage QR code feedback submission
4. **Follow-up** - Use insights for continuous improvement

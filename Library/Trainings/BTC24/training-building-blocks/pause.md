# Pause

## Overview

The Pause is a fundamental building block that creates space for reflection and mindfulness. It allows participants to step away from their busy routines and connect with themselves and the present moment. This building block is essential for creating the right mindset for deeper learning and personal growth.

## Objectives

- **Create a moment of stillness** and reflection
- **Help participants connect** with themselves
- **Prepare the group** for deeper engagement
- **Set a different tone** of energy

## Implementation

### When to Use
- At the beginning of the training to set the tone
- Between major activities to allow processing
- When the group needs to refocus
- Before important discussions or sharing

### How to Facilitate
- Guide participants to close their eyes or look down
- Use a gentle, calming voice
- Provide simple breathing instructions
- Allow for silence and stillness
- Gradually bring them back to the present

### Example Script
"Let's take a moment to pause. Close your eyes or look down, and take three deep breaths. Feel your feet on the ground, notice your breathing, and allow yourself to be fully present in this moment. Let go of whatever you were thinking about before you came here, and be here now, with us, in this space. Take your time... When you're ready, slowly open your eyes and return to the room."

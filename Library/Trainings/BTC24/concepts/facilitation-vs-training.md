# Facilitation vs. Training

## The Fundamental Difference

At Points of You®, both facilitation and training are core aspects of how we engage with individuals and groups, yet each serves a distinct purpose and approach.

## Facilitation

### What It Is
Facilitation within Points of You® is about creating immersive experiences that evoke emotional responses rather than simply transferring knowledge. The facilitator's role is to guide participants through a process of self-discovery, helping them connect with their emotions and insights.

### Key Characteristics
- **Focus:** Making participants feel something through carefully curated interactions and tools
- **Tools:** Wide variety of interventions – from verbal prompts and visual tools like vision boards and photographs, to more experiential techniques like body work, eco-therapy, and group healing
- **Approach:** Holding space for participants to reflect and grow, while respecting their personal journeys
- **Position:** The facilitator is never part of the group – they remain an impartial guide
- **Outcome:** Creating conditions for further personal growth

### Power Source
The power of Points of You® facilitation lies in the emotional connection and shared humanity experience. This approach emphasizes diversity and inclusiveness, bridging cultural, linguistic, and demographic differences.

## Training

### What It Is
Training in Points of You® takes on a different role. While facilitation focuses on guiding participants through an emotional experience, training is about equipping individuals with the skills and tools necessary to apply them effectively in both their professional and personal lives.

### Key Characteristics
- **Focus:** Teaching the methodology behind Points of You® – explaining the "why" behind the processes and tools, as well as how to effectively apply them
- **Approach:** Structured approach that combines theory with practical application
- **Outcome:** Giving participants the confidence and competence to use the tools in their professional environments
- **Method:** Clear framework for the tools, focusing on communication, coaching methods, and their practical uses

### Key Difference
Unlike facilitation, which is more fluid and responsive to the emotions and energy of the group, training is designed to impart specific knowledge and skills. Trainers offer a clear framework to ensure participants can replicate these experiences in their own contexts.

## Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | Facilitation | Training |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Role Focus** | Guide participants through immersive experiences designed to evoke emotions and personal insights | Teach the Points of You® methodology and equip participants with skills |
| **Primary Objective** | Facilitate personal growth and emotional breakthroughs through reflective and experiential activities | Develop participants' abilities to independently lead and facilitate Points of You® experiences |
| **Interaction Style** | Works fluidly, responding to group's energy and emotions; remains an impartial guide | Provides structured learning with clear framework and instructions; actively engages with participants |
| **Outcome** | Emotional connection and personal insights | Practical knowledge and skill mastery |

## When to Use Each

### Use Facilitation When:
- You want to create emotional breakthroughs
- Participants need space for self-discovery
- The goal is personal growth and reflection
- You're working with sensitive or vulnerable groups
- The focus is on healing or transformation

### Use Training When:
- You need to teach specific skills
- Participants must learn to apply tools independently
- The goal is knowledge transfer and skill development
- You're preparing people to become facilitators
- The focus is on practical application

## Integration

Both facilitation and training are essential in helping individuals and groups achieve growth, but each plays a different role in the overall Points of You® journey. The most effective practitioners can seamlessly integrate both approaches based on the needs of their participants and the objectives of their sessions.

# Ground Principles of Points of You® Training

## The Foundation

These four ground principles form the foundation of all Points of You® training. They guide how we approach every session and ensure that our training creates meaningful, transformative experiences.

## 1. Creating a Safe Space

### What It Means
During our training sessions, participants gradually reveal more of themselves to the group, and sometimes even to themselves for the first time. To facilitate this, we must provide a safe environment where participants feel secure enough to share.

### Why It Matters
- Participants can explore and address their real issues
- Allows for deep, transformative experiences
- Enables authentic sharing and vulnerability
- Builds trust and psychological security

### How We Do It
- Combine classic group dynamics with coaching techniques
- Establish clear group agreements
- Maintain confidentiality and respect
- Create non-judgmental environments
- Use appropriate facilitation techniques

## 2. Training Through Experience

### What It Means
At Points of You®, we focus on creating experiential learning rather than simply teaching theory. By using our tools, methods, and values, we craft training experiences that evoke emotions and foster deep understanding.

### Why It Matters
- Experiences and emotions make training memorable and impactful
- Participants learn by doing, not just listening
- Creates lasting change through personal engagement
- Builds deeper understanding than theoretical learning

### How We Do It
- Use visual tools like photos and vision boards
- Create hands-on activities and exercises
- Encourage personal reflection and sharing
- Design interactive group processes
- Focus on emotional engagement

## 3. Embracing Diversity

### What It Means
We bridge personal, cultural, demographic, and linguistic differences through our methods and the language of photos and phototherapy. This diversity allows participants to break down patterns and prejudices, creating a powerful reflection of our shared humanity.

### Why It Matters
- Breaks down barriers and prejudices
- Creates understanding across differences
- Reflects our shared humanity – feelings, hopes, and dreams
- Enables authentic connection despite differences

### How We Do It
- Use universal language of photos and metaphors
- Create inclusive environments
- Respect cultural differences
- Focus on common human experiences
- Encourage diverse perspectives

## 4. The Power of Face-to-Face Interaction

### What It Means
In a world dominated by virtual interactions, especially after the global pandemic, we prioritize face-to-face encounters. There is no substitute for eye contact, a hug, a scent, a voice, or a sound.

### Why It Matters
- Physical presence helps us open our hearts
- Removes masks and creates authentic connection
- Discovers strength and connection from being together
- Creates deeper, more meaningful interactions

### How We Do It
- Prioritize in-person training when possible
- Create intimate, personal environments
- Encourage physical presence and engagement
- Use touch and proximity appropriately
- Build genuine human connections

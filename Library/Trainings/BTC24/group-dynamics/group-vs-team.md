# Group vs Team: Understanding the Difference

## What is a Group?

### Definition
A group consists of people who share common characteristics or purposes, but may not necessarily work together toward a specific goal.

### Key Characteristics
- **Common Purpose:** United by shared objectives or interests
- **Long-term Interaction:** Ongoing relationships between the same people
- **Shared Outlook:** Common character or perspective that unites them
- **Flexible Structure:** Less formal organization and accountability

### Expert Definitions
- **Dr. Yaron Ziv:** "Long-term interactions between the same people whose common purpose unites them."
- **Harold Behr & Liesel Hearst:** "A number of people whose common outlook or character unites them."

## What is a Team?

### Definition
A team is a group of individuals who work together towards a common goal, with each member playing a specific role that contributes to the success of the team as a whole.

### Key Characteristics
- **Common Goal:** Clear, shared objectives
- **Collaboration:** Active cooperation and mutual support
- **Communication:** Regular, structured interaction
- **Mutual Accountability:** Shared responsibility for outcomes
- **Role Clarity:** Each member has specific responsibilities

### Key Differences

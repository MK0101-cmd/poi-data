### Individual Reflections

#### "Should Be" (Men in Boots)
**Theme**: Authenticity vs. Expectations

#### "Just Be" (Casual Pose)

**Theme**: Commitment & Care
This image represents care, commitment, and nurturing. Reflect on what or who you are devoted to in your life. How does this devotion shape your actions, and how do you show your commitment to those you care about?

### Combined Reflections

#### Balancing Expectations and Authenticity
The contrast between the "Should Be" card, which challenges norms, and the "Just Be" card, which encourages authenticity, highlights the tension between societal expectations and personal authenticity. Reflect on how you balance these aspects in your life. Are there areas where you feel pressured to conform, and how can you find more space to be your true self?

#### Integration of Devotion in Personal Identity
The "Devotion" card adds another layer by introducing the theme of deep commitment. Reflect on how your devotion to people, causes, or values influences your sense of self and your actions. How do you integrate this devotion with being true to yourself, as suggested by the "Just Be" card, while navigating societal expectations from the "Should be" card?

### Relationship Analysis

#### Navigating Societal Expectations and Personal Beliefs
The first and third images together suggest a journey of navigating between external expectations (what "should be") and internal values and commitments (devotion). Reflect on how you reconcile these in your daily life.

#### Authenticity in Devotion
The "Just Be" card encourages authenticity, while the "Devotion" card focuses on commitment. Reflect on how being your authentic self enhances the quality and depth of your devotion to others.

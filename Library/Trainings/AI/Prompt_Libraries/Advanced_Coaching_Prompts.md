# Advanced Coaching Prompts

## Overview
This library contains 20 specialized coaching prompts for advanced facilitation using the Points of YouÂ® methodology. These prompts go beyond basic photo card reflections to support complex coaching scenarios, leadership development, and team facilitation.

## Session Opening & Energy Setting

### 1. Start With a Pause
**Context**: Begin the session with a gentle shift in energy.
**Prompt**: "Let's take a moment to pause. Take three deep breaths. If you'd like, close your eyes. What do you notice in your body, in your mind? What word or image comes to you right now?"
**Facilitator Note**: This stage sets the emotional tone. It is not about doing --- it's about being.

### 7. Emotional Weather Forecast
**Context**: Quick emotional check-in at beginning or end of session.
**Prompt**: "If your current emotional state was a photo card, what would it look like? Would it be stormy, sunny, foggy, still?"
**Facilitator Note**: Photo language helps bypass rational resistance.

### 17. Morning Reflection Prompt
**Context**: Daily use.
**Prompt**: "Draw one photo card. Ask: What energy am I bringing into today? What's one word that would help guide my choices?"
**Facilitator Note**: Builds inner dialogue rituals.

## Visual Analysis & Symbolic Work

### 2. Observe a Photo as a Mirror
**Context**: Client has chosen or described an image.
**Prompt**: "What stands out to you in this image? What draws your attention? If this image could speak, what would it say? And what would it *not* say?"
**Facilitator Note**: Look for symbolic elements --- color, light, space, distance, characters. These details invite introspection.

### 3. Expand Through Contrasts
**Context**: After sharing an image or idea.
**Prompt**: "What would be the opposite of what you see or feel here? What card might show a completely different side of this situation?"
**Facilitator Note**: This supports mental flexibility and challenges fixed narratives.

### 5. Reframe a Leadership Challenge
**Context**: Executive is stuck with a team issue.
**Prompt**: "Imagine this problem was a scene on a card. What does it look like? Now, choose a word that could represent a new lens or value to bring to this challenge."
**Facilitator Note**: Use the phototherapy + word combo to reframe challenges.

### 11. Unexpected Feedback from a Card
**Context**: Coaching session with feedback topic.
**Prompt**: "Choose a photo card. Imagine it's giving you feedback on how you show up in your role. What is it praising? What is it gently pointing out as blind spots?"
**Facilitator Note**: The card becomes a safe proxy for tough truths.

## Perspective Shifting & Empathy Building

### 4. Role Reversal Through a Face Card
**Context**: The client draws a Faces card.
**Prompt**: "Who is this person in your story? What is their relationship to your current situation? If they could talk, what would they want you to know?"
**Facilitator Note**: Faces enable empathy and perspective-shifting --- two key goals of our method.

### 8. Word as a Lens for Leadership Style
**Context**: Exploring leadership identity.
**Prompt**: "Pick a word card that resonates with your current leadership. Now pick one that reflects how you *want* to lead. What's the distance between them?"
**Facilitator Note**: Word cards can highlight gaps between self-perception and aspiration.

### 9. Inner Dialogue Between Two Cards
**Context**: Two cards chosen with tension between them.
**Prompt**: "Let's imagine these two cards are in a conversation. What does one say to the other? Where do they agree? Where do they conflict?"
**Facilitator Note**: Externalizing inner conflict allows safer reflection.

### 13. Step Into Someone Else's Shoes
**Context**: Conflict resolution or team work.
**Prompt**: "Pick a Faces card that could represent your colleague. What do you think they are feeling? What are they afraid to say? What do they need to hear from you?"
**Facilitator Note**: Powerful tool for emotional intelligence development.

### 14. Dialogue with Future Self
**Context**: Goal-setting or transition coaching.
**Prompt**: "Choose a card that represents your future self in one year. Now, what advice does this person have for you today? What are they celebrating?"
**Facilitator Note**: Activates vision and commitment.

## Story Building & Narrative Work

### 6. Create a Story From 3 Cards
**Context**: The client selects 3 photo cards.

**Facilitator Note**: Use story-building to reveal unconscious narratives.

### 12. Create a Visual Mantra
**Context**: End of process or retreat.
**Prompt**: "Choose one photo card and one word card. Together, what statement do they create? Let that be your mantra for the next 30 days."
**Facilitator Note**: Combines image, language, and intention.

### 20. End-of-Journey Integration
**Context**: Final stage of a longer process.
**Prompt**: "Look at all the cards you've selected during this journey. What's the theme that ties them together? If you had to name the story of this journey in one sentence --- what would it be?"
**Facilitator Note**: Closes the loop and gives narrative coherence.

## Action Planning & Integration

### 10. From Insight to Action
**Context**: Moving from Focus to Doing.
**Prompt**: "Based on your insight today, what is one thing you'll do in the next 24 hours, one in the next week, and one in the next month?"

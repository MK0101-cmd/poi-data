# INTERACTION Training Series

## The Art of Interaction in Points of You

Welcome to the comprehensive INTERACTION training series, designed to help facilitators master the art of interaction in the Points of You methodology. This modular training program breaks down the complex skill of interaction into manageable, focused components that build upon each other.

## Overview

In Points of You, the magic happens through two key elements: the participants' experience with the tools and the interactions facilitated by the coach or trainer. While the tools---images, metaphors, and cards---guide participants to deep personal reflections, the interaction with the facilitator is where transformative insights occur.

This training series focuses on how to use interactions to deepen participants' self-exploration, challenge limiting beliefs, and turn insights into actions.

# PR Technique: Preparation and Reducing Resistance

## What is PR?

PR (Preparation and Reducing Resistance) is a technique used to build curiosity and reduce resistance, especially when a facilitator anticipates that the participant might struggle with an upcoming insight or message. It creates an open and safe space for challenging discussions, softening potential defensiveness by preparing the participant for what's coming.

> *"We use PR to make the participant curious and reduce resistance. If I know I'm about to share something challenging, I introduce it gently, emphasizing that it's simply an observation and they don't have to agree."*

## The Psychology Behind PR

When participants feel surprised or ambushed by challenging feedback, they often respond with defensiveness. PR works by:
- **Creating anticipation** rather than surprise
- **Giving choice** rather than forcing acceptance
- **Framing as observation** rather than judgment
- **Building curiosity** rather than fear

## The PR Process

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Challenge
Begin by acknowledging that what you're about to share might be difficult to hear.

### Step 2: Express Uncertainty
Show that you're not certain how they'll receive the information.

### Step 3: Emphasize Potential Value
Highlight why this insight could be important for their growth.

### Step 4: Ask Permission
Give them the choice to engage or not.

## PR Example

Instead of saying:
> *"You're being defensive and that's preventing you from growing."*

Use PR:
> *"I noticed something that might be important for you, but I'm not sure how you'll feel about it. It could be uncomfortable to hear, but I believe it could make a significant difference. Can I share this with you?"*

## Key Elements of Effective PR

### 1. Authentic Uncertainty
- "I'm not sure how you'll feel about this..."
- "I could be wrong, but I noticed..."
- "This is just my observation..."

### 2. Value Proposition
- "I believe this could be important..."
- "This might make a significant difference..."
- "I think this could help you..."

### 3. Permission Seeking
- "Can I share this with you?"
- "Would you like to explore this?"
- "Is it okay if I tell you what I'm seeing?"

### 4. Safety Framing
- "You don't have to agree..."
- "This is just my perspective..."
- "You can tell me if I'm off base..."

## When to Use PR

- **Before sharing challenging observations**
- **When introducing difficult topics**
- **Before giving feedback that might trigger defensiveness**
- **When you sense resistance building**
- **Before exploring sensitive areas**

## When NOT to Use PR

- **For simple, non-threatening information**
- **When time is extremely limited**
- **When the participant is already very open**
- **For positive feedback or encouragement**

## Practice Exercise

Think of a challenging observation you might need to share with a participant. Practice using the PR technique:

1. What challenging insight do you want to share?
2. How can you acknowledge it might be difficult?
3. What value can you highlight?
4. How will you ask for permission?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Being too vague** - "I noticed something" without specifics
- **Over-apologizing** - Making it seem like you're doing something wrong
- **Rushing the process** - Not giving them time to prepare
- **Being insincere** - If you're not genuinely uncertain, don't fake it

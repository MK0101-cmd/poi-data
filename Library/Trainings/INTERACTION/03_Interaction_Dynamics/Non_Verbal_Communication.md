# Non-Verbal Communication

## Reading the Unspoken Messages

Non-verbal cues---such as body language, facial expressions, or even the tone of a participant's voice---are critical components of interaction. Often, participants communicate more through their non-verbal behavior than through words, and the facilitator's role is to notice these cues and respond appropriately.

> *"A participant's body language can tell you more than their words. Watching how they sit, breathe, or move can guide your interaction."*

## The Importance of Non-Verbal Communication

### Why Non-Verbals Matter

- **Authentic expression** - Body language often reveals true feelings
- **Emotional state** - Non-verbals show what participants are really experiencing
- **Comfort level** - Physical cues indicate safety and openness
- **Engagement** - Non-verbals show how connected participants are
- **Resistance** - Physical signs often appear before verbal resistance

### The Facilitator's Advantage

- **Early warning system** - Spot issues before they become problems
- **Deeper understanding** - Get the full picture of what's happening
- **Better responses** - Adjust your approach based on what you observe
- **Enhanced rapport** - Mirroring and matching builds connection

## Key Non-Verbal Cues to Watch

### Body Language

## Responding to Non-Verbal Cues

### Matching and Mirroring

#### Subtle Matching
- **Posture:** Gently match their sitting position
- **Pace:** Adjust your speaking pace to theirs
- **Energy:** Match their energy level
- **Breathing:** Sync with their breathing rhythm

#### When to Mirror
- **Building rapport** - Early in the session
- **Creating safety** - When they seem uncomfortable
- **Encouraging openness** - When they're closed off

#### When NOT to Mirror
- **Negative emotions** - Don't mirror anger or sadness
- **Defensive postures** - Don't mirror closed body language
- **Overwhelming energy** - Don't match anxiety or panic

### Responding to Specific Cues

#### Closed Body Language
- Use PR techniques to create safety
- Ask gentle, open-ended questions
- Avoid pushing or forcing
- Create more physical space

#### Emotional Cues
- Acknowledge what you're seeing
- Offer support and validation
- Use silence to allow processing
- Be ready to adjust your approach

#### Resistance Cues
- Don't push against the resistance
- Use PR to explore what's happening
- Ask about their experience
- Respect their boundaries

## Common Non-Verbal Mistakes

### Misreading Cues
- Assuming closed body language means resistance
- Thinking silence means agreement
- Not recognizing cultural differences
- Overinterpreting single gestures

### Inappropriate Responses
- Pushing when participants are closed
- Ignoring emotional cues
- Not adjusting to their energy
- Being too aggressive or too passive

### Missing Cues
- Focusing only on words
- Not paying attention to subtle changes
- Being distracted or unfocused
- Not trusting your observations

## Cultural Considerations

### Different Cultural Norms
- **Eye contact** - Varies by culture
- **Personal space** - Different comfort levels
- **Gestures** - Different meanings
- **Emotional expression** - Different norms

### Best Practices
- **Learn about participants' backgrounds**
- **Ask about preferences**
- **Be sensitive to differences**
- **Don't assume universal meanings**

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Observation Practice
- Practice noticing non-verbal cues in everyday interactions
- Pay attention to body language, facial expressions, and tone
- Practice reading what people are really communicating

### Exercise 2: The Mirroring Practice
- Practice subtle matching with friends or family
- Notice how it affects the interaction
- Learn to do it naturally and authentically

### Exercise 3: The Response Practice
- Practice responding to different non-verbal cues
- Learn to adjust your approach based on what you observe
- Develop your intuition about what participants need

## Technology and Non-Verbals

### Virtual Sessions
- **Limited view** - Can only see head and shoulders
- **Camera angles** - May not show full body language
- **Technical issues** - Can interfere with observation
- **Screen fatigue** - Affects participants' non-verbals

### Adapting to Virtual
- **Focus on what you can see** - Face, eyes, upper body
- **Pay attention to voice** - Tone, pace, volume
- **Ask about what you can't see** - "How are you feeling in your body?"
- **Use technology to your advantage** - Screen sharing, breakout rooms

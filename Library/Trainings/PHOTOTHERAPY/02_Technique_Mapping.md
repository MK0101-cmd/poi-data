# Technique Mapping

## The POY Framework as Applied Phototherapy

The POY decks (Faces, Coaching Game, Punctum, Flow, Speak Up, etc.) act as ready-made projective tools. They allow participants to project feelings, beliefs, and personal stories onto ambiguous yet emotionally evocative visuals and titles.

This process mimics and evolves phototherapy techniques --- but with structure, pacing, and facilitation baked in.

## Mapping Weiser's Techniques to POY

| Phototherapy Technique | POY Equivalent | Application |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Photos taken by client | Selecting a card that represents a personal truth | Self-exploration, emotional mirroring |
| Photos of the client | Faces deck -- reflecting identity, social image | Self-acceptance, persona work |
| Family albums | Cards that evoke family memories | Generational healing, legacy work |
| Others' photos | Exploring societal lenses | Identity, judgment, cultural roles |
| Projective images | All POY decks | Symbolism, metaphor, subconscious patterns |

## Detailed Technique Applications

### Photos Taken by the Client → Card Selection
- **POY Application**: User selects cards that resonate with their current state
- **Facilitation Focus**: "What draws you to this card right now?"
- **Therapeutic Value**: Reveals unconscious priorities and emotional needs

### Photos of the Client → Faces Deck
- **POY Application**: Using Faces cards to explore self-perception and identity
- **Facilitation Focus**: "Which face represents how you see yourself today?"
- **Therapeutic Value**: Addresses self-image, social identity, and self-acceptance

### Family Albums → Memory-Evoking Cards
- **POY Application**: Cards that trigger family or generational memories
- **Facilitation Focus**: "What family story does this card remind you of?"
- **Therapeutic Value**: Explores inherited patterns, family dynamics, and legacy

### Others' Photos → Societal Lens Cards
- **POY Application**: Cards representing external perspectives or cultural norms
- **Facilitation Focus**: "How might others see this situation differently?"
- **Therapeutic Value**: Challenges assumptions, explores cultural identity

### Projective Images → All POY Decks
- **POY Application**: Using any card for symbolic exploration
- **Facilitation Focus**: "What does this image say about your inner world?"
- **Therapeutic Value**: Accesses subconscious material through projection

## Integration Principles

1. **Respect the Projection**: Never correct or interpret the user's projection
2. **Follow the Energy**: Notice which aspects of the card draw attention
3. **Explore Layers**: Move from surface to deeper meaning gradually
4. **Honor Resistance**: Pay attention to what the user avoids or dismisses
5. **Co-create Meaning**: Build understanding together rather than imposing interpretation

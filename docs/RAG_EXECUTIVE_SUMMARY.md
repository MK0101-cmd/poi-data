## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Database Schema (6 Core Tables)

```
documents           → Primary content storage
document_chunks     → Chunked content with embeddings
cross_references    → Document relationships
tags               → Content categorization
document_tags      → Many-to-many tag relationships
card_metadata      → Photo/reflection card metadata
```

### 2. Embedding Strategy

**Primary Model:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Dimensions**: 1536
- **Cost**: $0.02 per 1M tokens
- **Estimated Initial Cost**: $150-300 (one-time)

**Chunking Strategy:**
- Target chunk size: 500 tokens (±200)
- Section-based chunking with context preservation
- Estimated total chunks: 5,000-15,000

### 3. Search Capabilities

**Supported Query Types:**
1. **Semantic Search** - "How to facilitate conflict resolution?"
2. **Card-Based Retrieval** - "FACES open-minded card #5"
3. **Contextual Exploration** - "Related content to this story"
4. **Filtered Discovery** - "90-minute team building workshops"
5. **Hierarchical Navigation** - "All content in FACES deck"

**Search Features:**
- Vector similarity search (pgvector)
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Multi-filter support (category, tags, duration, audience)
- Cross-reference traversal
- Related content suggestions

## Shoe Factory Story
Many years ago, the owner of a large shoe factory decided to expand his business and break into new markets. To this end, he sent two of his senior employees on a market research mission to Asia, giving each the task of gathering information from a different part of the continent.

After weeks at sea, the first man arrived at his destination, alighted the boat, and was immediately stunned by what he encountered: None of the locals was wearing shoes; in fact, they had never heard of such things.

The man sent an urgent cable to his boss: "I have arrived and checked. They don't know anything about shoes. We won't be able to sell a single pair. I'm returning immediately."

The second employee also spent a number of weeks at sea before arriving at his destination in a different Asian port. He, too, could hardly believe what he saw when he got off the boat: Not a single person there was wearing shoes; they had never heard of such things.

The man sent an urgent cable to his boss: "I've arrived. They don't know anything about shoes here. The potential is enormous; the market is huge. We can sell millions of pairs a year. I've started making contacts."

## Reflection Questions

- **Is there absolute truth?**
- **How do I react when someone thinks differently than I do?**
- **How far am I willing to go in order to express my point of view?**

## Common Responses

### Rigid Point of View
- You don't understand a thing. I know what I see. That cannot be. Whatever you say. There is no chance in the world that I am mistaken.

### Open to Different Perspectives
- Come show me how you see things from your point of view. Maybe I am missing something. We view things completely differently. This and that, too. Things you see from here you can not see from there.

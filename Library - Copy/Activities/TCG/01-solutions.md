## Folk Tale
In a land far, far away lived a farmer and his two sons. As young boys, the sons would help their father with the farm work; but when they grew older, they left their small village for the big city. Sadly, the temptations of the city got the better of them, and the two young men veered off the straight and narrow path their father had laid out for them: The older brother turned murderer, while the younger became a thief; and the two soon found themselves behind bars serving jail sentences. The years went by, and the father grew old and weak, and was no longer able to plow his fields. He knew that without help right away, he would lose all he had built over the years and would be left destitute and hungry. So, the father sat down and composed a letter to his younger son. In his letter, the father asked his son to approach the prison board and explain the situation, hoping that this would secure the young man's release. When the prison board's negative reply soon came, the saddened father, in his desperation, composed a similar letter to his older son. Immediately on receiving his father's letter, the older son responded with one of his own. "Father, don't dare touch the field. All the treasures from my murder victims are hidden there," he wrote, and sent it off. Two days later, 100 policemen raided the father's field, turning over every piece of earth. Of course, they found nothing at all. Another two days passed, and the father received a second letter from his older son: "My dear father," he had written. "I hope the policemen did a good job; I did the best I could. With love, your son."

## Key Quotes

> Your approach to problems, determines whether you will or will not find a solution to them. One approach has it that all problems are catastrophes, while another says that no problem is too great. The moment you say no problem is too great, 99% of the problem have disappeared, and your entire perspective of it has changed.

> Obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to get over it.
> 
> **Michael Jordan**

> We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.

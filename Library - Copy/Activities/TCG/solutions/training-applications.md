## Core Learning Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Help participants shift from problem-focused to solution-focused thinking
- Encourage creative problem-solving approaches
- Build resilience and persistence in facing challenges
- Develop a growth mindset around obstacles

### Secondary Goals
- Improve team problem-solving dynamics
- Build confidence in addressing complex issues
- Develop creative thinking skills
- Foster collaborative solution-finding

## Exercise 1: Problem Reframing Workshop

### Setup
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- **Group Size**: 4-6 people per group
- **Materials**: Flip chart, markers, sticky notes

### Process
1. **Individual Reflection** (10 minutes)
   - Each person writes down a current problem on a sticky note
   - Use [Reflection Questions](reflection-questions.md) for guidance

2. **Problem Sharing** (15 minutes)
   - Each person shares their problem with the group
   - Group members ask clarifying questions

3. **Reframing Exercise** (20 minutes)
   - For each problem, group brainstorms how to reframe it as an opportunity
   - Use the question: "What opportunity is hidden in this challenge?"

4. **Solution Brainstorming** (15 minutes)
   - Generate creative solutions for reframed problems
   - Encourage "wild ideas" and build on each other's suggestions

### Debrief Questions
- How did reframing change your perspective on the problem?
- What was the most creative solution generated?
- How can you apply this approach to future challenges?

## Exercise 2: The Farmer's Field Challenge

### Setup
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Group Size**: 6-8 people
- **Materials**: Problem scenario cards

### Process
1. **Story Introduction** (5 minutes)
   - Present the [Farmer's Field story](stories-tales.md)
   - Highlight the creative solution used

2. **Challenge Scenarios** (20 minutes)
   - Give each group a different problem scenario
   - Challenge them to find a "Farmer's Field" type solution
   - Encourage unconventional approaches

3. **Solution Presentation** (15 minutes)
   - Each group presents their creative solution
   - Other groups provide feedback and additional ideas

4. **Learning Reflection** (5 minutes)
   - What made the solutions creative?
   - How can this approach be applied to real problems?

### Sample Scenarios
- **Office**: "How can we get the IT department to fix our computers without directly asking?"
- **Family**: "How can we get teenagers to clean their rooms without nagging?"
- **Community**: "How can we get people to use the new recycling bins?"

## Exercise 3: Solution-Focused Language Practice

### Setup
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Group Size**: Pairs
- **Materials**: Language transformation worksheet

### Process
1. **Language Analysis** (10 minutes)
   - Pairs identify problem-focused vs. solution-focused language
   - Use examples from [Common Responses](common-responses.md)

2. **Transformation Practice** (15 minutes)
   - Each person shares a problem-focused statement
   - Partner helps transform it to solution-focused language
   - Practice both speaking and listening

3. **Real Application** (5 minutes)
   - Each person identifies one real situation to apply this to
   - Commit to using solution-focused language

### Language Transformation Examples
- **From**: "This is impossible" → **To**: "What would make this possible?"
- **From**: "It's not my fault" → **To**: "What can I do to help solve this?"
- **From**: "This is too complex" → **To**: "What's one simple step we could take?"

## Exercise 4: Creative Problem-Solving Tournament

### Setup
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Group Size**: 4-6 teams of 3-4 people
- **Materials**: Challenge cards, timer, scoring system

### Process
1. **Team Formation** (5 minutes)
   - Create diverse teams with different problem-solving styles
   - Each team chooses a name and motto

2. **Challenge Rounds** (45 minutes)
   - 3 rounds of 15 minutes each
   - Each round presents a different type of problem
   - Teams compete to generate the most creative solutions

3. **Solution Evaluation** (20 minutes)
   - Teams present their best solutions
   - Judges evaluate creativity, feasibility, and innovation
   - Award points for different criteria

4. **Celebration & Learning** (10 minutes)
   - Recognize winning teams and creative solutions
   - Discuss what made solutions effective
   - Identify key learnings for future problem-solving

### Challenge Categories
- **Round 1**: Resource constraints (limited time, money, people)
- **Round 2**: Communication barriers (language, culture, technology)
- **Round 3**: Resistance to change (skeptical stakeholders, fear)

## Facilitation Tips

### Creating Safe Space
- **Encourage wild ideas**: "There are no bad ideas in brainstorming"
- **Build on others' ideas**: "Yes, and..." rather than "Yes, but..."
- **Celebrate creativity**: Acknowledge unconventional approaches

### Managing Resistance
- **Address fear**: "It's natural to feel uncomfortable with new approaches"
- **Provide support**: "What would help you feel more confident?"
- **Start small**: Begin with low-risk problems to build confidence

### Ensuring Application
- **Action planning**: Help participants identify specific next steps
- **Accountability partners**: Pair people to support each other
- **Follow-up**: Schedule check-ins to review progress

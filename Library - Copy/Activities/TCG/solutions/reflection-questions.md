# Reflection Questions - Solutions

## Core Self-Assessment Questions

### Problem Response Patterns
- **What is my automatic response when I run into a problem?**
  - *Purpose*: Identify default problem-solving patterns
  - *Follow-up*: Are these patterns helpful or limiting?

- **What takes up more of my energy -- accusations or solutions?**
  - *Purpose*: Assess focus on blame vs. action
  - *Follow-up*: How can I shift more energy to solutions?

- **Do I simply make a check mark or do I find a real solution?**
  - *Purpose*: Distinguish between surface-level and deep problem-solving
  - *Follow-up*: What would a "real solution" look like?

## Deeper Exploration Questions

### Problem-Solving Approach
- **How do I typically approach complex problems?**
- **What strategies have worked best for me in the past?**
- **What patterns do I notice in my problem-solving process?**

### Mindset & Perspective
- **Do I see problems as obstacles or opportunities?**
- **How does my mindset affect my ability to find solutions?**
- **What beliefs do I hold about my problem-solving abilities?**

### Creative Thinking
- **When was the last time I used a completely unconventional approach?**
- **How comfortable am I with "thinking outside the box"?**
- **What would help me be more creative in problem-solving?**

## Group Discussion Questions

### Team Problem-Solving
- **How does our team typically approach problems?**
- **What role do I play in group problem-solving?**
- **How can we improve our collective problem-solving process?**

### Learning from Challenges
- **What have I learned from past problem-solving experiences?**
- **How do I handle it when my first solution doesn't work?**
- **What support do I need to be a better problem-solver?**

## Action-Oriented Questions

### Immediate Application
- **What problem am I currently facing that needs a creative solution?**
- **What's one small step I can take today toward solving it?**
- **Who could I ask for help or a different perspective?**

### Long-term Development
- **How can I develop my problem-solving skills further?**
- **What resources or tools would help me be more effective?**
- **How can I help others develop their problem-solving abilities?**

## Facilitation Notes

### For Trainers
- **Timing**: Allow 5-10 minutes for individual reflection before group discussion
- **Environment**: Create a safe space for honest self-assessment
- **Follow-up**: Use responses to identify common patterns and resistance points

### Common Responses to Watch For
- **Avoidance**: "I don't really have problems" or "Everything is fine"
- **Blame**: Focus on who's at fault rather than solutions
- **Overwhelm**: "It's too complex" or "I don't know where to start"

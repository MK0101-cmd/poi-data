# Common Responses - Solutions

## Problem-Focused Responses

### Blame and Victimhood
- "It's impossible. I'm stuck."
- "Why does it always happen to me?"
- "It's your fault."
- "I don't know. Why now? What's the problem?"

### Overwhelm and Avoidance
- "What can I do? It's too complex."
- "I don't want to hear about any more problems."
- "There's no solution. It's difficult."
- "Why is everything always so complicated?"

### Characteristics of Problem-Focused Responses
- **External locus of control**: Blaming others or circumstances
- **Fixed mindset**: Believing problems are insurmountable
- **Energy drain**: Focusing on what's wrong rather than what's possible
- **Avoidance**: Trying to escape rather than engage with the problem

## Solution-Focused Responses

### Openness and Curiosity
- "Perhaps we should try."
- "I am looking but cannot find what I am looking for."
- "What do you suggest?"

### Characteristics of Solution-Focused Responses
- **Internal locus of control**: Taking responsibility for finding solutions
- **Growth mindset**: Believing problems can be solved
- **Energy building**: Focusing on possibilities and opportunities
- **Engagement**: Actively seeking ways to address the challenge

## Response Patterns Analysis

### The Blame Cycle
1. **Problem occurs** → 2. **Blame others/circumstances** → 3. **Feel powerless** → 4. **Avoid action** → 5. **Problem persists**

### The Solution Cycle
1. **Problem occurs** → 2. **Take responsibility** → 3. **Seek options** → 4. **Take action** → 5. **Learn and adapt**

## Facilitation Strategies

### Addressing Problem-Focused Responses

#### For Blame Responses
- **Acknowledge**: "I hear that this feels unfair and frustrating"
- **Reframe**: "What would it look like if we focused on what we can control?"
- **Redirect**: "Let's explore what options we have available"

#### For Overwhelm Responses
- **Break down**: "What's one small piece we could tackle first?"
- **Support**: "What resources or help do you need?"
- **Simplify**: "Let's start with the simplest possible solution"

#### For Avoidance Responses
- **Validate**: "It's natural to want to avoid difficult situations"
- **Explore**: "What would make this feel more manageable?"
- **Encourage**: "What's the smallest step you could take?"

### Encouraging Solution-Focused Responses

#### Building Confidence
- **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge any progress made
- **Highlight strengths**: Point out past problem-solving successes
- **Provide support**: Offer resources and encouragement

#### Shifting Perspective
- **Reframe problems**: "What opportunity is hidden in this challenge?"
- **Focus on learning**: "What can we learn from this situation?"
- **Emphasize choice**: "What options do we have available?"

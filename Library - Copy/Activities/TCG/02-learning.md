## Zen Story
A frog that lived by the ocean decided one day to go on a journey through the expanses of the large stretch of land alongside its home -- and duly set out, visiting new and interesting places and enjoying every moment.

While on its journey, the frog came across a well, and decided it could do with a drink. To its pleasant surprise, the ocean frog met another frog in the well who, too, was somewhat taken aback by the unexpected visitor. After all, the well frog and its family had grown up in the well, and had never left it, not knowing at all what was on the outside.

The well frog then turned to the visitor and asked: "What exactly is an ocean?"

And the ocean frog replied: "an ocean is a very large, a huge body of water."

"What do you mean by huge?" asked the well frog in return. "Something like half the depth of the water in our well here?"

"No, It is much bigger."

"So, it is the same depth as this well?" questioned the well frog.

"No," replied the ocean frog again. "It is even bigger."

The well frog was skeptical, and said impatiently: "OK, it certainly can't be bigger than the full depth of this well; nothing in the world is bigger than the depth of this well."

"I truly do not wish to offend you," replied the ocean frog, "but it is much, much bigger indeed."

The well frog was angered, and spoke harshly: "There is nothing bigger than this well; you are talking nonsense. Go away from here; you are angering me with your stories about an ocean."

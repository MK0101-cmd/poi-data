# Stories & Tales - Should Be

## The Mother's Projection

I have a friend who lives in a very well to do neighborhood. Both she and her husband are successful lawyers; they are two intelligent individuals and each hold prestigious university degrees.

I had been at their home for about an hour or so during a recent visit when my friend told me that she had to leave for a few minutes to pick up her daughter from a dance class. When the two of them returned, the young girl was sobbing and clearly very upset.

I asked my friend what had happened to bring on such crying, and she replied:

"I always wanted to be a dancer and my parents wouldn't hear of it. The same thing is not going to happen to my daughter. She has to be a dancer -- even if it is tough on her. I missed out big time because my parents forced me to become a lawyer. I will never force her to be a lawyer -- she'll be a dancer!"

## Key Insights from the Story

### The Cycle of Projection
The mother is repeating the same pattern she experienced with her parents, but in reverse. She's still not allowing her daughter to choose her own path.

### External vs. Internal Motivation
The mother's decision is driven by her own unmet needs and regrets, not by what's best for her daughter.

### The Illusion of Choice
While the mother thinks she's giving her daughter choice, she's actually imposing her own agenda just as her parents did.

### Authentic vs. Projected Desires
The daughter's tears suggest she may not want to be a dancer, but her mother can't see this because of her own projection.

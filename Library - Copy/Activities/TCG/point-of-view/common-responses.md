# Common Responses - Point of View

## Rigid Point of View Responses

### Defensive and Dismissive
- "You don't understand a thing. I know what I see."
- "That cannot be. Whatever you say."
- "There is no chance in the world that I am mistaken."

### Characteristics of Rigid Responses
- **Absolute language**: "cannot," "no chance," "never"
- **Dismissive**: Rejecting others' perspectives without consideration
- **Defensive**: Protecting own viewpoint from challenge
- **Closed-minded**: Unwilling to consider alternative views

## Open to Different Perspectives Responses

### Curious and Collaborative
- "Come show me how you see things from your point of view."
- "Maybe I am missing something. We view things completely differently."
- "This and that, too. Things you see from here you can not see from there."

### Characteristics of Open Responses
- **Inviting language**: "Come show me," "Maybe I am missing"
- **Acknowledging differences**: "We view things completely differently"
- **Perspective-taking**: "Things you see from here you can not see from there"
- **Collaborative**: Seeking to understand rather than convince

## Response Patterns Analysis

### The Rigid Cycle
1. **Different perspective presented** → 2. **Feel threatened** → 3. **Defend own view** → 4. **Reject other view** → 5. **Stay stuck in own perspective**

### The Open Cycle
1. **Different perspective presented** → 2. **Feel curious** → 3. **Explore other view** → 4. **Integrate insights** → 5. **Expand understanding**

## Facilitation Strategies

### Addressing Rigid Perspectives

#### For Defensive Responses
- **Acknowledge**: "I can see this feels challenging to hear"
- **Reframe**: "What if we explore this together rather than debate it?"
- **Validate**: "Your perspective is valuable, and so is theirs"

#### For Dismissive Responses
- **Stay curious**: "What makes you feel that way?"
- **Find common ground**: "What part of this resonates with your experience?"
- **Encourage exploration**: "What would it look like if this were true?"

#### For Closed-minded Responses
- **Address fear**: "What are you most afraid of in considering this perspective?"
- **Build safety**: "How can we create a safe space to explore this?"
- **Start small**: Begin with low-risk perspective exploration

### Encouraging Open Perspectives

#### Building Curiosity
- **Ask open questions**: "What's interesting about this perspective?"
- **Encourage exploration**: "What would you like to know more about?"
- **Validate questions**: "That's a great question, let's explore it together"

#### Fostering Collaboration
- **Model openness**: "I'm curious about your perspective on this"
- **Encourage sharing**: "What would it look like to find a solution that works for both of us?"
- **Celebrate differences**: "It's great that we can see this from different angles"

# Stories & Tales - Uncertainty

## The Navigator's Compass

In ancient times, there was a skilled navigator who was known for his ability to find his way across the vast ocean, even when the stars were hidden by clouds and the winds were unpredictable. Other sailors would often ask him how he managed to navigate through such uncertainty and ambiguity.

The navigator would smile and say, "I have learned to trust my compass, even when I cannot see the stars. I have learned to read the signs of the ocean, even when the weather is unpredictable. And most importantly, I have learned to embrace the uncertainty, knowing that it is part of the journey."

He continued, "The ocean is vast and unpredictable, but it is also full of opportunities and discoveries. If I only sailed when I was certain of the weather and the stars, I would never have discovered new lands or learned new ways of navigating. Uncertainty is not something to be feared - it is something to be embraced as a teacher and a guide."

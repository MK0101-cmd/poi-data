## Story: The Chilean Miners

In 2010, a group of Chilean miners became trapped underground when a mine collapsed. The miners were stranded in a small chamber more than 2,000 feet underground, with no means of communication or escape. Despite the dire situation, the miners banded together and formed a tight-knit team, relying on each other for support, encouragement, and survival. They rationed their food and water, took turns leading daily prayers and exercises, and even organized a "TV station" to keep themselves entertained and informed about the rescue efforts. After 69 days underground, all 33 miners were rescued in a miraculous feat of collaboration and teamwork between the miners, their families, and the rescue workers who worked tirelessly to save them.

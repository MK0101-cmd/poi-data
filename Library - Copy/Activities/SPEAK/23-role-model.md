## Story: The Lighthouse

One evening, the daily ritual walk of Master Edamir and his disciple ShÃ¢ram led them not far from the lighthouse of Magdesh.

Pointing to the lighthouse, Magdesh said: "Master, I want to be like this lighthouse: to shine day and night, to enlighten the world with my knowledge and to dispense my lights to those who ask for them."

Without answering, Edamir beckoned his disciple to follow him.

When they reached the lighthouse, Edamir said: "Look at the lighthouse. What do you see?" The brightness of the lighthouse was so intense, its light so powerful, that Sharam was almost totally dazzled. He had to look away for fear of going blind.

The next night, Edamir and Sharam set off in a boat and quickly sailed away.

Pointing to the horizon, Edamir asked, "What do you see?" Like a wide-eyed old owl, Sharam said, "I see a tiny light flashing, far, far away."

"It is the light of the Magdesh lighthouse. The same light that dazzled you last night. You want to shine your light on the world. It is a noble purpose. But which of these two lights do you want to be? The bright one that blinds, or the modest one that guides?"

**Oriental tale**

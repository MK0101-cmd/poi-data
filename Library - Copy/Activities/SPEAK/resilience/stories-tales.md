## Kintsugi - The Art of Repair

There is a difference between repairing and patching up. Patching up is a fast, haphazard solution, where we try to regain the very functionality of what has been broken, but without attending to any other criteria. But when you repair something, you know that love and the lesson learnt are fused together to create a new piece, a new life, which is much stronger and more beautiful than the previous.

Let's repair what has been broken, but let's do it focusing on what we want, not on what we have suffered or experienced. The time has come to look ahead, to lift our head high and set an objective. The key here lies in the idea that as we repair ourselves, we start to define our future, our objectives and our goals, facing our fears with courage and bravery. Repairing what is broken is an exercise of courage, because it means accepting that you may break again.

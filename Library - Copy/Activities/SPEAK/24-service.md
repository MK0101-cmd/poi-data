## Story: The Starfish

One day, an old man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking up starfish and throwing them back into the ocean. The old man approached the boy and asked, "What are you doing?"

The boy replied, "I'm throwing starfish back into the ocean. The tide is going out, and if I don't throw them back, they'll die."

The old man looked at the beach, which was covered with thousands of starfish, and said, "But there are so many starfish. You can't possibly make a difference."

The boy picked up another starfish, threw it into the ocean, and said, "I made a difference to that one."

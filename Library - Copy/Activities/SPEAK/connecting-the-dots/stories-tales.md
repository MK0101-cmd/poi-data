# Stories & Tales - Connecting the Dots

## Steve Jobs' Commencement Speech

If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something â€“ your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

## Story: Amanda Susanti Cole and Sayurbox

"Now the children prefer to work in Jakarta rather than returning to their hometowns to continue their parents' plantations." said one of the farmers to Amanda Susanti Cole.

Apparently, this was caused by the difficulty in distributing the crops to the market. Seeing this opportunity, Amanda, who at that time had worked for two years in a chemical distribution company, decided to quit her job and open a garden with the help of her uncle. Amanda, who has had a hobby of farming since she was young, wants to help farmers by establishing easy distribution channels for farmers so that their crops can reach cities. Having skills in business and technology, in 2017 Amanda decided to open her first business, Sayurbox. Selling vegetables digitally, which initially only started from using social media, has begun to expand using applications. Previously, Amanda only sold vegetables, now Amanda also provides a variety of other organic preparations that people can order easily at affordable prices. Sayurbox, which has partners with 300 farms and plantations, while serving 50,000 customers and making 1,000 deliveries every day, made Amanda the Seedstars Indonesia Winner, in the startup competition and received funding for her business in 2018, and was included in the ranks of Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia in 2019.

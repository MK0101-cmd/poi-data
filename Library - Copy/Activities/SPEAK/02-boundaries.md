## Personal Story

I've always equated being a good friend, teammate, and family member with doing whatever anyone asks of me. If someone needs help, you help. If someone's having a get-together and invites you, you'd better be there. Saying no is rude, so never, ever say no. I think this is a common thing we teach little girls â€“ always be polite and take care of everyone else before you take care of yourself.

Once I'd taken my neighbor to the airport at 4am that morning. She'd texted me the night before: "Hey. Can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow? At 4am?" Three grimacing emojis. I said yes, of course, and I showed up at 4am on the dot with my trunk popped. She got in my car and said, "Wow! I can't believe you actually said yes. My husband is mad at me for asking you because he thought it was really rude. But I told him you said yes!"

I couldn't stop thinking about that the whole way back home. Why did I say yes? Well, because I thought I couldn't say no. It was that simple. The fact that even the asker was surprised I said yes made me think pretty deeply about my personal boundaries and that they were basically non-existent.

Would saying no to someone result in something terrible happening? Would it make someone swear me off as a friend? Of course not.

Others say no all the time, and it's fine. I gave myself "permission" to say no to things I don't want to do. Life is just too short to waste your time doing things for the sake of doing things.

## Story: The Marshmallow Challenge

There was a social experiment where teams of Harvard MBA graduate students were placed to compete against kindergartners. The challenge was which team will build the highest tower using only spaghetti sticks, string and tape. The graduate students took the challenge seriously. They approached the problem analytically, discussing how to best combine the sticks, string, and tape to achieve maximum altitude.

If you think the winners were the Harvard students, think again. The kindergartners drubbed them. Here's why. The MBA spent most of their time speculating trying to figure everything out in advance. They also spent much time arguing who should be in charge. As a result, their constructions kept falling apart. But the kids got to work quickly. They tried one way of building. If didn't work, they quickly tried another. They learned from their mistakes and got in a lot more tries. As a result, they quickly built one tall structure after another.

The MBA students spent too much time speculating on possible What If's while the kids moved quickly from What If to How to.

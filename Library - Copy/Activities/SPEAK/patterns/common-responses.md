# Common Responses - Patterns

## Pattern-Blind Responses
- "I don't see any patterns in my behavior."
- "That's just how I am - I can't change."
- "I don't want to overthink things."
- "I prefer to focus on the present moment."
- "I don't believe in looking for hidden meanings."
- "I don't want to be too analytical."
- "I prefer to keep things simple."
- "I don't want to dwell on the past."

## Pattern-Aware Responses
- "I notice patterns in my behavior and want to understand them."
- "I want to learn from my patterns to make better decisions."
- "I believe pattern recognition helps me grow and improve."
- "I want to help others recognize and change their patterns."
- "I find that understanding patterns gives me more control over my life."
- "I want to create positive patterns in my work and relationships."
- "I believe pattern awareness is essential for personal growth."
- "I want to use pattern recognition to make better choices."

## Training Application Notes
- Use these responses to help participants identify their own pattern recognition patterns
- Facilitate discussions on the impact of different response types on growth and decision-making
- Encourage participants to move from blind responses towards aware responses
- Highlight that pattern recognition is a skill that can be learned and developed

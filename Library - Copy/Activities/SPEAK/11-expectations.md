## Story: The Dragon Dream

A classic dream story, which has been told for a long time, especially in China and Korea, is about a man who sleeps and dreams. He dreams of a terrible, dreadful dragon opening its fiery mouth, very threatening and screaming. The man, distraught, asks him.

"But what is going to happen? I am terrified: are you going to eat me?"

"What do you want me to say?" The dragon replies. "This is YOUR dream!"

**Chinese Folktale**

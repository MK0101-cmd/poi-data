## Story: An Autobiography in Five Chapters

#### Chapter 1
I walk down the street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I fall in. I am lost… I am helpless. It isn't my fault.
It takes forever to find a way out.

#### Chapter 2
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don't see it. I fall in again.
I can't believe I am in the same place. But it isn't my fault.
It still takes a long time to get out.

#### Chapter 3
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it is there.
I fall in… it's a habit… but my eyes are open. I know where I am. It is my fault.
I get out immediately.

#### Chapter 4
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I walk around it.

#### Chapter 5
I walk down a different street.

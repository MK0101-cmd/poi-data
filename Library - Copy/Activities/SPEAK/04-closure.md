## Story: The Glass of Water

Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the typical "glass half empty or glass half full" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, "How heavy is this glass of water I'm holding?"

Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.

She replied, "From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn't matter. It all depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute or two, it's fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little. If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me."

As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, "our stresses, worries and unfinished closures in life are very much like this glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed â€“ incapable of doing anything else until you release them.

## Key Quotes

> Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
> 
> **Dr. Seuss**

> Closure is not about tying up loose ends, but about acknowledging the impact of past experiences and finding a way to integrate them into our lives.
> 
> **John Whittington**

> It is always important to know when something has reached its end. Closing circles, shutting doors, finishing chapters, it doesn't matter what we call it; what matters is to leave in the past those moments in life that are over.
> 
> **Paulo Coelho**

> People of our time are losing the power of celebration. Celebration is an active state, an act of expressing reverence or appreciation. Celebration is a confrontation, giving attention to the transcendent meaning of one's actions.
> 
> **Abraham Joshua Heschel**

> There is no real ending. It's just the place where you stop the story.
> 
> **Frank Herbert**

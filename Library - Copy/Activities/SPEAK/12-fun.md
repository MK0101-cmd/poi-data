## Story: Pike Place Fish Market

In the 1980s, the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle was on the brink of closure, with demotivated and unhappy employees struggling to keep the business afloat. John Yokoyama, a former employee turned owner, decided to make a change. During a meeting, an employee suggested they not only save the business but make it "world-famous" by introducing flying and thrown fish, games with customers, and staff attitudes of always enjoying their work.

With the decision made to try something new, a simple act of playfulness among the staff changed everything. They started to have fun, interact with customers, and make each other laugh. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish; the fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots will call out the order which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter to be wrapped. The repeated shouting of fish orders started out as a prank on one employee, but became a tradition as the display was enjoyed by customers. When at work, the fish market's staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while throwing ordered fish. Occasionally they will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss. The market displays a sign in the general area which reads "Caution: Low Flying Fish".

The result was a dramatic turnaround in the business. The fish market became more profitable and started attracting more customers. The employees were happier and more motivated, and they took pride in their work. The fish market is a famous landmark in Seattle and has become a tourist attraction from all around the world because of the unique and lively atmosphere that the employees create.

## Story: The Monk and the Cow

A monk set out on his travels across a faraway land. As night was falling he found a humble shack, in the middle of nowhere. A poor family lived there and the mother, father and children were dressed in rags. The monk asked if he could spend the night. "You are most welcome" they said and prepared a simple meal consisting of milk, cheese and cream. The monk greatly appreciated their simple generosity. When they finished eating, he asked how they managed to survive in such an isolated place. "We have one cow" said the wife, "We sell her milk to our neighbors and keep enough for our needs."

The next morning, the monk said his goodbyes and set out to continue his journey. Not far from the family's little hut, he came across the cow. The monk pondered for a moment before leading the cow to the edge of a nearby cliff and pushing it over the edge.

Several years later the monk again passed that same road where he found lodging so many years ago, and decided to visit the family. As he rounded the curve, he saw a splendid mansion, surrounded by landscaped gardens. The monk knocked on the door. The father answered, now well-dressed and looking healthy. He recognized the monk immediately. While they ate, the monk asked what had changed in the years that had passed. "You know, we used to have a cow." explained the father, "She kept us alive. One day she fell down the cliff and died. To survive, we had to develop skills we didn't know we had. We were forced to come up with new ways of doing things. It was the best thing that ever happened to us! We are now much better off than before." The old monk smiled.

# Stories & Tales - Purpose

## Personal Story: Finding Purpose Through Service

Finding purpose is not just an individual pursuit; it's also a collective one. It's about connection, and it's about living up to your values. It's about doing something that matters, and it's about being part of something bigger than yourself. Purpose doesn't have to be grand or noble, but it does have to be meaningful to you. And it does have to be based on your own strengths and interests.

It's important to remember that purpose is not a one-time thing. It's not something you find and then you're done. Purpose is a journey. It's a process of continually discovering what matters to you and what makes your heart sing. And it's something that evolves over time.

In order to find your purpose, it's important to take the time to reflect on your life and your experiences. What are the things that have brought you the most joy and fulfilment? What are the things that you're good at? What are the things that you care deeply about?

Once you have a better understanding of your strengths, interests, and values, you can start to look for ways to bring those things into your work and your life. You can start to ask yourself how you can use your unique talents and passions to make a difference in the world.

Remember, finding your purpose is not about achieving some external goal. It's about discovering who you are and what you stand for, and then living your life in alignment with that. It's about finding the courage to be true to yourself and to live a life that is authentically yours.

**Facilitator Guidelines**

-   **Hold Safe Space**: Remind participants this is a place for honesty
    without judgment.

-   **Balance Depth & Lightness**: When working with fears or limiting
    beliefs, create safety through humor, grounding, and empathy.

-   **Encourage Curiosity**: With photos and cards, guide participants
    to observe details, colors, and emotions.

-   **Supervision Approach**: Use field examples to connect practice
    with methodology.

-   **Shift from Awareness to Action**: Always close reflection rounds
    with a move toward strengthening strengths and defining next steps.

**Detailed Flow**

**1. Opening & Pause (60 min)**

-   **Facilitator Script**:

"In our last session we were filled with inspiration and ideas. But
sometimes, when we leave the safe container, doubts and inner 'noise'
arise -- reasons why it's not possible. Today we will learn to see
beyond: to recognize our barriers and to reclaim our strengths as
facilitators."

-   **Pause & Tune-In (25 min)**: Play the chosen playlist. Invite
    participants to relax, breathe, and let go.

-   **Check-in Round**: Each shares energy level (1--10) and a metaphor
    for "how I am right now."

**2. Supervision (25 min)**

-   Open space for participants to bring questions from their 1:1 client
    practice.

-   Topics may include differences between maps, solo vs. facilitated
    processes, or challenges in applying the method.

**3. Identifying Barriers (45 min)**

-   **Individual Reflection (5 min)**: Write down: *What challenges me
    most in my professional facilitation?*

-   **Guided Visualization (5 min)**: Close eyes, imagine the feared
    situation. Where does it happen? With whom? What emotions or
    sensations arise?

-   **Card Work (10 min)**: Choose one Punctum photo card that reflects
    "the pit I don't want to fall into." Reflect on details, story, and
    personal associations.

-   **Hidden Word Card (5 min)**: Draw a hidden word. Explore: What is
    my first reaction? How does it connect to my challenge? What is the
    opposite of this word for me?

-   **Pair Sharing (14 min)**: Exchange stories in pairs. Just presence,
    no solutions.

-   **Self-Reflection (5 min)**: Identify beliefs and patterns behind
    the barrier.

-   **Group Sharing (15 min)**: Harvest insights together.

**4. Break (30 min) -- Photo Assignment**

-   Instruction: "During the break, take one photo of something that
    attracts you. You may know why or not -- simply follow the impulse."

**5. Identifying Strengths (140 min)**

**Step 1 -- Personal Photo Reflection (15 min)**

-   Explore:

    -   What did I choose to photograph?

    -   What details stand out?

    -   What angle did I choose, and what does it add?

    -   What new perspective do I see now?

-   Write 3 minutes of notes.

-   Short group sharing.

**Step 2 -- Black & White Lens (20 min)**

-   Convert photo to black & white using phone editor.

-   Reflect individually: What shifted? What became clearer? What was
    lost?

-   Write insights.

**Step 3 -- Group Feedback Round (40 min)**

-   Select a few participants' photos to project.

-   Group offers reflections without the owner explaining.

-   Each participant notes what they hear, without judgment.

-   Then divide into groups of 4--5 for rotation: each photo gets 5--7
    min of reflection.

**Step 4 -- Strength Identification (20 min)**

-   Write: *What strength does this photo reflect about me as a
    facilitator/coach?*

-   Quick sharing round: each names their identified strength.

**Step 5 -- Barriers to Strength (20 min)**

-   Draw a hidden Flow card. Reflect: *What prevents this strength from
    showing up fully in my professional life?*

-   Write 2--3 min.

-   Journaling: *What am I willing to do to amplify this strength?*
    Write a short action plan.

-   Sharing round: each shares one action step.

**6. Guided Visualization & Integration (15 min)**

-   Facilitator leads a meditation:

    -   Breathe, relax body.

    -   Imagine being surrounded by a sphere of light.

    -   Meet your higher guidance, asking to increase the "volume" of
        your chosen strength.

    -   Visualize what changes when you embody this strength fully.

    -   Return gently to the present.

-   Journaling: note key images and feelings.

**7. Closing Reflection (10 min)**

-   Round of sharing:

    -   *What happened to me today?*

    -   *What is my strongest insight?*

    -   *What question do I take with me onward?*

-   If short on time: one word check-out.

**Participant Guidelines**

-   Be open and honest -- barriers are part of growth.

-   Listen without judgment during pair and group sharing.

-   Let the cards, photos, and reflections surprise you.

-   Move from awareness to action: identify one concrete step to
    strengthen your facilitation.

**Materials Needed**

-   Whiteboard/flipchart or large paper.

-   Markers and sticky notes.

-   Participant notebooks.

-   Music for short pauses.

**Facilitator Guidelines**

-   **Model Curiosity**: Show how to transform ordinary questions into
    powerful ones.

-   **Encourage Simplicity**: Remind participants that the best
    questions are short and clear.

-   **Balance Depth & Accessibility**: Ensure participants see both the
    theory and the practice.

-   **Coach Gently**: When refining questions, reflect back rather than
    correcting.

-   **Celebrate Diversity**: There is no one "right"
    question---different phrasings open different perspectives.

**Detailed Flow**

**1. Opening & Introduction (20 min)**

-   **Facilitator Script**:

"At Points of You速, questions are the foundation of every process.
Without a question, we can't choose a card---and without a card, there
is no mirror for reflection. Today, we'll learn how to craft questions
that truly move processes forward."

-   **Check-in Round**: Each participant shares a recent situation where
    a single question shifted their perspective.

**2. Why Questions Matter (15 min)**

-   Short input:

    -   Questions open doors.

    -   They set the focus for the entire process.

    -   A well-crafted question creates clarity, depth, and direction.

-   Example: *"What is my relationship with change?"* vs. *"Am I afraid
    of change?"*

**3. Principles of Crafting Questions (30 min)**

-   **Key Principles**:

    1.  **Open-Ended**: Not yes/no. Invites exploration.

    2.  **Broad Enough to Explore, Focused Enough to Be Meaningful**.

        -   Example: "Relationships" is too broad. "My relationship with
            my father" is focused.

    3.  **Short and Clear**: One sentence, 5--6 words max.

    4.  **Neutral Tone**: Avoid leading or judgmental wording.

-   **Activity**: On sticky notes, participants write examples of "weak"
    questions and then reframe them into "powerful" ones.

**4. Practical Framework: Time Frames & Focus Areas (25 min)**

Introduce the **three time perspectives**:

-   **Past**: What led me here? What patterns repeat?

-   **Present**: What is working/not working now? What is blocking me?

-   **Future**: What do I want to invite? What will happen if I say
    yes/no?

**Focus Options**:

-   Challenge/difficulty.

-   Resource/strength.

-   Insight/learning.

**Exercise**: Participants choose one life area (relationships, career,
self-growth) and formulate one past, one present, and one future
question.

**5. Practice in Pairs: Creating & Refining Questions (30 min)**

-   **Instructions**:

    -   Partner A shares a topic they'd like to explore.

    -   Partner B helps them refine it into a powerful question.

    -   Switch roles after 15 minutes.

-   Encourage active listening, curiosity, and simplicity.

**6. Group Sharing & Reflection (20 min)**

-   Participants share their best-crafted question with the group.

-   Facilitator highlights patterns:

    -   Which questions felt energizing?

    -   Which were too vague or too narrow?

    -   What shifted when clarity was added?

**7. Closing & Integration (10 min)**

-   **Facilitator Script**:

"Powerful questions are like keys---they unlock hidden doors within us.
Remember, clarity comes not from having all the answers but from daring
to ask the right question."

-   Final Round: Each participant shares *one question they are leaving
    with today* that they would like to explore further with the cards.

**Participant Guidelines**

-   Keep your questions short and clear.

-   Use open-ended language: *"What," "How," "Where," "When."*

-   Explore past, present, and future dimensions.

-   Don't rush---let the question emerge naturally.

-   Be ready to be surprised by the answers that surface.

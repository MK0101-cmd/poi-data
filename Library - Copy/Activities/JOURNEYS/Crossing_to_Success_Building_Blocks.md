**Crossing to Success**

*A Full Facilitator Process Pack for Global Use*

**Introduction for Facilitators**

**Philosophy**:\
Crossing to Success is not only about external change, but about the
**inner transition** (Bridges' model: Endings, Neutral Zone, New
Beginnings). Our role as facilitators is to create a safe, inspiring,
and structured journey that helps managers move from uncertainty to
clarity, from isolation to partnership, from confusion to committed
action.

**Your Role as Facilitator**:

-   Be a **mirror and anchor** -- hold space, listen deeply, and name
    what is emerging.

-   Use Points of You® tools (Faces, The Coaching Game, Speak Up,
    ClicKit) to bypass logic and invite intuition and emotion.

-   Normalize resistance, doubts, and fatigue. They are part of the
    process.

-   Balance structure (agenda, timing) with flexibility (follow the
    energy in the room).

**Tone & Presence**:

-   Calm, respectful, and inspiring.

-   Speak slowly, allow silence, and trust the process.

-   Use storytelling and metaphors often.

**Program Logistics**

-   **Number of workshops**: 8 × 4-hour sessions (one every 3 weeks).

-   **Participants**: 15--25 managers.

-   **Materials**:

    -   Points of You® card sets (Faces, Coaching Game, ClicKit, Speak
        Up).

    -   Music + speakers.

    -   Journals & pens.

    -   Flipcharts, markers, post-its.

    -   Centerpiece (candles, natural elements, symbolic object).

**Room Setup**:

-   Circle of chairs, no tables in the center.

-   Centerpiece with cards spread around.

-   Breakout areas for pairs and small groups.

**Workshop Flow Template (used in all 8 sessions)**

Each session follows the 4-step Points of You® method:

1.  **Pause** -- create space for reflection and presence.

2.  **Expand** -- explore multiple perspectives using cards and
    dialogue.

3.  **Focus** -- crystallize insights into a clear takeaway.

4.  **Do** -- transform insights into small, concrete action steps.

**Detailed Session Design**

**Session 1: Transition Compass**

**Objectives**: Build trust, explore personal experiences of transition,
and set group foundation.

**Flow**:

1.  **Welcome & Intention Setting (10 min)**

    -   Facilitator script: "We are beginning a journey together, not
        just as individuals, but as a community of leaders who are
        crossing into a new way of working."

    -   Invite each to choose a **Speak Up card**: "With what energy do
        I arrive today?"

2.  **Mini Input: Bridges' Model (15 min)**

    -   Share 3 stages: Endings -- Neutral Zone -- New Beginnings.

    -   Ask: "Where do you feel you are today?"

3.  **Card Activity -- The Compass of Change (30 min)**

    -   Cards on the floor (Faces or Coaching Game).

    -   Choose 3 cards:

        -   What am I leaving behind?

        -   What is uncertain for me?

        -   What new beginning do I sense?

    -   Journal for 10 min.

    -   Share in pairs, then in plenary.

4.  **Group Harvest (20 min)**

    -   Write common themes on flipchart.

    -   Ask: "What is the gift hidden in this uncertainty?"

5.  **Closing Round (10 min)**

    -   One word that captures how I feel now.

**Facilitator Notes**:

-   Expect emotions of grief, fear, and excitement. Hold space.

-   Keep pace slow, let silence work.

**Session 2: My Role -- Inside View**

**Objectives**: Self-reflection on current role clarity, strengths, and
struggles.

**Activities**:

-   **Silent Faces card choice**: "Who am I today as a leader?"

-   Reflection prompts:

    -   What do these eyes, mouth, posture say about me?

    -   How do I feel looking at this face?

-   **Reflection card**: "What quality am I most expressing?"

-   Journaling: 3 strengths I use, 2 areas I avoid.

-   Group dialogue: "What part of my role do I resist the most?"

**Facilitator Tips**:

-   Encourage honesty, not "corporate answers."

-   Use storytelling from your own leadership.

**Session 3: My Role -- Outside View**

**Preparation**: Before workshop, participants interview 2--3 key
stakeholders.

**Activities**:

-   Share insights on posters.

-   Choose a **card that represents how others see me.**

-   Dialogue: "Where is the gap between how I see myself and how others
    see me?"

-   Pair coaching with guiding questions:

    -   What gap do you most want to close?

    -   What small action will start closing it?

**Session 4: Bridging the Gaps**

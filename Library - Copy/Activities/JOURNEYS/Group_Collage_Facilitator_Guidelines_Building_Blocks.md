**ðŸŸ  Group Collage -- Facilitator Guidelines**

**Turning Point Program \| Facilitator Instructions**

**ðŸ”¹ 1. Timing & Energy -- Managing the Process in Real Time**

After 8--10 minutes of collage work:

-   If the group is slow, drifting, or even progressing smoothly ---
    **introduce time pressure**.

-   Say clearly:\
    *"You have 5 more minutes to complete your collage."*\
    Then, if needed:\
    *"Last 2 minutes -- complete the collage in **silence**. No more
    talking."*

The goal is to push the group into a more intuitive, instinctive mode of
decision-making and co-creation under mild pressure.

**ðŸ”¹ 2. If the Process Gets Stuck**

If you sense confusion, tension, or paralysis:

-   Pause the process and ask the group to **stand together around the
    collage**.

-   Gently ask:\
    *"How are you doing?"*\
    *"Would anyone like to share something about the process so far?"*

This brief emotional check-in often releases stuck energy and re-engages
the group. Even if the process flows smoothly, it\'s still recommended
to stand around the collage at the **end** --- never return to chairs
before the sharing.

**ðŸ”¹ 3. Initial Sharing -- Standing Around the Collage**

When participants say the collage is complete:

-   Ask them to remain standing around it and say:

*"Let's stay close to what we created together. Who would like to share
something about the experience --- or about the collage you created as a
group?"*

Let 1--2 people speak naturally, then begin **individual deepening**:

Ask 1 question at a time to each speaker. Choose based on their energy
and what feels right.

Examples:

-   *"How did this process make you feel?"*

-   *"What role do you feel you took in the group?"*

-   *"Where in your personal life does this dynamic show up?"*

-   *"How does this reflect your relationships outside this room?"*

Encourage authenticity, not performance. Stay present and curious.

**ðŸ”¹ 4. Group Reflection -- Collective Insight**

After several individuals have shared, you may invite broader group
inquiry. Ask 1--2 of the following:

-   *"Who do you think naturally led the process?"*

-   *"Was there a moment you wanted to say something and didn't?"*

-   *"Looking back now -- is there anything you would have done
    differently?"*

-   *"Does anyone feel they need to say something to someone here?"*

-   *"How did your behavior or attitude during the process mirror how
    you show up in life?"*

Use these gently. Don't rush. Let the silence work for you.

Your role is to **hold the space** --- not to fix, interpret, or solve.

**ðŸ”¹ 5. Emotional Tone -- Holding Space with Presence**

What we aim to create:

-   An **intimate** space of emotional honesty

-   A **non-judgmental** space of reflection

-   A **curious** space for seeing oneself and others more clearly

Encourage:

-   Vulnerability

-   Pauses and silences

-   Moments of resonance between group members

Discourage:

-   Analysis

-   Defensiveness

-   Rushing to closure

**ðŸ”¹ 6. Closing the Process -- With Strength and Softness**

**Always close with a clear, uplifting statement** that validates the
intensity and purpose of the process.

You may say something like:

*"This process is designed to bring out tension --- either internal or
within the group. Sometimes both. It's not meant to be clean or
comfortable. It's not something you 'win'."*\
*"And yet... you showed up. You created something real. You stayed
present. That's powerful."*

*"In moments like this, we see ourselves --- how we react under
pressure, what roles we default to, and how we connect (or don't) with
others."*\
*"And from that awareness, we grow. We become able to choose. To act ---
not just react."*

End with acknowledgment:

*"You did something amazing. You saw yourselves. You saw each other. You
worked through friction, and found moments of connection. Be proud."*

Let this **moment of pride and recognition** stay with them. It's not
about a perfect result --- it's about **presence, insight, and human
connection under pressure**.

-   **Balance Safety and Challenge**: Hold a safe space while daring to
    confront, reflect, and stretch participants.

    profiles and workshop designs.

    refine clarity.

    clarity but also a roadmap for professional practice.

**Detailed Flow**

**1. Opening & Pause (45 min)**

-   **Facilitator Script**:

"In our previous workshop we explored strengths and areas for growth as
facilitators. Today we dive into our roles, sharpen our vision, and
begin shaping workshops that reflect who we are and what we want to
bring to the world."

-   **Check-in Discussion (10 min)**: Where did last session's learnings
    show up in the past two weeks?

-   **Supervision Q&A (20 min)**: Questions before participants begin
    practicum (staj).

    relax, breathe, and let go.

**a. The Facilitator as a Parent**

-   Accept participants as they are.

-   Challenge and stretch them beyond comfort zones.

-   Hold them with care, empathy, and trust.

-   Be the "responsible adult" -- create a safe and structured
    container.

**b. The Facilitator as a Leader**

-   Inspire by authenticity and example.

-   Focus on people's true needs.

-   Lead the room with humility and responsibility.

-   Model resilience, empowerment, and professionalism.

**c. The Facilitator as a Container**

-   Stay centered even in conflict or challenge.

-   Ensure a safe group contract is honored at all times.

**Activity**

-   Individual: Using hidden Coaching Game cards, create a map of your
    strengths and weaknesses as facilitator in each role. Write
    reflections (15 min).

-   Pairs: Exchange and discuss your maps, coaching each other (20 min).

-   Group: Share insights and discuss what supports growth in each role
    (20 min).

-   Individual journaling: *What action can I take to grow as a
    facilitator?* (5 min).

**3. Vision in Practice (135 min)**

**Step 1 -- Personal Vision (15 min)**

-   Journaling prompt: *"How do I see my professional practice with
    Points of You® tools moving forward?"*

**Step 2 -- Faces Reflection (20 min)**

-   Each selects a Faces card intuitively.

-   Explore the story of the chosen face: age, culture, joys, pains,
    dreams, motto.

-   Journaling: How does this image mirror my ideal client?

**Step 3 -- Client Profiles (30 min)**

-   Define:

    -   Who are my clients? Individual vs. group?

    -   Existing clients or new audiences?

    -   What needs do the tools meet?

    -   Which offerings suit them (deeper processes, variety,
        innovation)?

-   Write draft client profiles.

**Step 4 -- Trios Work (30 min)**

-   In trios, share your client profiles.

-   Partners ask clarifying questions, highlight gaps, and refine
    definitions.

**Step 5 -- Collective Debrief (10 min)**

-   Group sharing: What shifted in my clarity of vision?

**4. How to Build a Workshop (70 min)**

-   **Input**: Difference between a "process map" and a full workshop.

    -   Workshop has a clear beginning, middle, and end.

    -   All 4 stages of Points of You® methodology are present (Pause,
        Expand, Focus, Action).

    -   Designed for group dynamics, not only individual reflection.

**Steps to Design a Workshop**

1.  Define your target audience.

2.  Clarify objectives.

3.  Define the process you want participants to experience.

4.  Create the flow:

    -   Opening and framing

    -   Pause activity

    -   Expansion with tools (cards, pairs, groups)

    -   Focus: insights, harvesting

    -   Action: practical application

5.  Build a process map: tools + questions.

6.  Choose a workshop title.

7.  Test it with peers or family.

8.  Marketing: adapt platforms and messaging to your audience.

**Practice (30 min)**

-   Begin sketching a draft flagship workshop. Use design sheets
    provided.

-   Facilitators (trainers) circulate to support refinement.

**5. Closing (5 min)**

-   **Sharing Round**: *"What am I taking with me from today?"*

-   Frame next session: participants will bring draft flagship workshops
    to test in front of the group.

**Participant Guidelines**

-   Be honest and open in self-reflection.

-   Support peers with curiosity and respect.

-   Think both personally (my vision, my role) and practically (my
    clients, my offerings).

-   Use today to begin shaping your unique contribution through Points
    of You®.

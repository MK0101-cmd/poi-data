# TAKERS SERIES - Building Block Overview

## Overview
The Takers Series helps participants explore the places where we are mean to ourselves and to others. After meeting our "taker" parts, there is less. Less energy, less confidence, less joy, less peacefulness... These are the parts which awaken feelings of shame, insecurity, doubt and fear.

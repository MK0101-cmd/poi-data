# KNOWING SERIES

The places where we know deep inside.

The parts of us that just know. Connected, independent, on their path. These parts make us turn into leaders. The places that are open to dealing with the quest itself and the journey - less about others, more about me.

## Reflections in this Series

### Individualist
/ UNIQUE / DIFFERENT / NONCONFORMIST / UNAFFECTED /

**Story:**
I ask myself what making it really means. I know I want to make my living solely as a musician, but I also want to be recognized as someone unique, defined by my voice, by my abilities as a songwriter, to have the world know my songs and my melodies just as they had known and acknowledged the songs of the Beatles. I want to do this on my own terms, I want to be singular, and if that means being marginalized, then so be it. I will become stronger, and even if no one else knows who I am, I shall know myself…

### Ambitious
/ GOAL ORIENTED / SUCCESSFUL / TAKES INITIATIVE /

**Story:**
Churchill was, to a marked extent, forcing himself to go against his own inner nature: a man who was neither naturally strong, nor naturally particularly courageous, but who made himself both in spite of his temperamental and physical endowment. The more one examines Winston Churchill as a person, the more one is forced to the conclusion that his aggressiveness, his courage, and his dominance were not rooted in his inheritance, but were the product of deliberate decision and iron will.

/ PURPOSEFUL / VISIONARY / CHARISMATIC / PROACTIVE /

**Story:**
In the 1930's there was a young boy who had become addicted to and obsessed with eating sugar. His mother decided to get help and took the long and hot journey with her son walking many miles and hours under the scorching sun.

She finally reached Gandhi and asked him to tell her son to stop eating sugar, it wasn't good for his health. Gandhi replied, "I cannot tell him that. But you may bring him back in a few weeks and then I will talk to him." The mother was confused and upset and took the boy home.

Two weeks later she came back. This time Gandhi looked directly at the boy and said "Boy, you should stop eating sugar. It is not good for your health." The boy nodded his head and promised he wouldn't. The boy's mother was puzzled. She asked "Why didn't you tell him that two weeks ago when I brought him here to see you?"

Gandhi smiled and said "Mother, two weeks ago I was eating a lot of sugar myself."

**Story:**
A woman stepped outside her house and spotted three men with long white beards sitting in her yard. She did not recognize any of them. She said to them: "I do not know you, but you are probably hungry. Please come into my house for a small meal." "We are not entering together." one of the men explained: "This is Wealth," he pointed at one of his friends, "that is Success, and I am Love. Now go to your husband and discuss with him which of us you would like in your home." "Great!!" the husband said. "In that case, we'll invite Wealth in. He will fill our home with abundance!" His wife did not agree. "Darling, why don't we invite in Success?" Their daughter in law, who overheard the conversation from the room next door, suggested: "Would it not be better if we invite Love inside?" "Our house will be flooded with Love! Maybe we should listen to her advice. Go outside and invite Love to be our guest." He asked his wife. Love got up and started walking towards the house. The two other men got up as well and followed his steps. Surprised, the woman asked Wealth and Success: "I invited Love in, why are you two entering as well?" The three men answered together: "If you would have invited in Wealth or Success, the other two would have stayed outside. But since you invited Love… Everywhere Love goes, we follow.

### Dominant

Tony Soprano: Am I in the what?

Meadow Soprano: Whatever you want to call it. Organized crime.

Tony Soprano: That's total crap, who told you that?

Meadow Soprano: Dad, I've lived in the house all my life. I've seen the police come with warrants. I've seen you going out at three in the morning. Tony Soprano: So you never seen Doc Cusamano going out at three in the morning on a call?

Meadow Soprano: Did the Cusamano kids ever find $50,000 in krugerrandts and a .45 automatic while they were hunting for Easter eggs? Tony Soprano: I'm in the waste management business.

### Courageous
/ BRAVE / GUTSY / RISK TAKER / DARING /

**Story:**
Mulan was washing clothes when she heard that the army was recruiting new soldiers. She knew that her father was too old and too ill to survive the war, so she decided to disguise herself as a man to go in his place. The tale continues with Mulan leaving for the battlefield carrying the sword inherited from the ancestors of the family. She fought for ten or twelve years and gained high merit, but refused any reward and retired to her hometown instead. During the war, she met an officer, who is normally named Jin Yong, with whom she fell in love. Legends say that after 10 years on the battlefield Mulan was promoted to general. When Jin Yong learned that Mulan was a woman, he became more attached to her. In many versions of the story both Mulan and Jin Yong dream about getting married to each other. One day, before a very difficult battle, Mulan decided to go onto the battlefield in women's clothing so her soldiers would realize her true identity. The reaction of the soldiers was one full of respect and admiration. They were overwhelmed by her bravery, grace, and wisdom. After another heroic triumph, the emperor wanted to reward Mulan. He was surprised that the bravest of his soldiers was a female. However, Mulan asked for nothing but a horse to ride home.

### Independent
/ SELF-RELIANT / PROACTIVE /

**Story:**
And I realized that some things just don't work that way. Life isn't a fairytale. And the person you fall in love with doesn't always love you back. But that's ok, because at the very least it makes you stronger. And brings you to a place where you can fall in love with yourself. And that to me is more important than finding someone that only makes you complete when they are around. It's really about finding the person that will teach you all the lessons you need to know... so that you feel complete all by yourself.

### Content
/ PLEASED / SATISFIED / HAPPY /

**Story:**
You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.

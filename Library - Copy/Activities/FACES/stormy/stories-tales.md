## Drama Queen
**Freddie Mercury's "The Show Must Go On"**
"The Show Must Go On" is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May. The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life; he was dying from complications due to HIV/AIDS, although his illness had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill. Mercury was so ill when the band recorded the song in 1990 that May had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's performance, May states; "I said, 'Fred, I don't know if this is going to be possible to sing.' And he went, 'I'll fucking do it, darling' – vodka down – and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal."

## Rocker
**Leonard Cohen's Chelsea Hotel**
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel you were famous, your heart was a legend. You told me again you preferred handsome men but for me you would make an exception. And clenching your fist for the ones like us who are oppressed by the figures of beauty, you fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind, we are ugly but we have the music."

*Leonard Cohen - Chelsea Hotel*

## Rebel
**Albert Camus on Rebellion**
Freedom, that terrible word inscribed on the chariot of the storm, is the motivating principle of all revolutions. Without it, justice seems inconceivable to the rebel's mind. There comes a time, however, when justice demands the suspension of freedom. Then terror, on a grand or small scale, makes its appearance to consummate the revolution. Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being. But one day nostalgia takes up arms and assumes the responsibility of total guilt; in other words, adopts murder and violence.

## Warrior
**Carlos Castaneda's Warrior Wisdom**
To be a warrior a man has to be, first of all, and rightfully so, keenly aware of his own death. But to be concerned with death would force any one of us to focus on the self and that would be debilitating. So the next thing one needs to be a warrior is detachment. The idea of imminent death, instead of becoming an obsession, becomes an indifference.

Now you must detach yourself; detach yourself from everything. Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he is incapable of abandoning himself to anything. Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he can't deny himself anything. A man of that sort, however, does not crave, for he has acquired a silent lust for life and for all things of life. He knows his death is stalking him and won't give him time to cling to anything, so he tries, without craving, all of everything.

## Sensual
**J. Ruth Gendler's Sensuality**
Sensuality has exquisite skin and she appreciates it in others as well. There are other people whose skin is soft and clear and healthy but something about Sensuality's skin announces that she is alive. When the sun bursts forth in May, Sensuality likes to take off her shirt and feel the sweet warmth of the sun's rays brush across her shoulder. This is not intended as a provocative gesture but other people are, as usual, upset. Sensuality does not understand why everyone else is so disturbed by her.

## Extrovert
**ORLAN's Performance Art**
ORLAN is a performance artist who uses her own body and the procedures of plastic surgery to make "carnal art". Her name is written all letters in majuscule because ORLAN doesn't want to fit into the lines or the ranks. She is transforming her face, but her aim is not to attain a commonly held standard of beauty. ORLAN is the only artist working so radically with her own body, asking questions about the status of the body in society.

## Radical
**Marina Abramovic's Rhythm 0**
Serbian-born artist Marina Abramovic's most famous and self-enduring performance art piece, Rhythm 0, pushed her endurance and mind to new limits. Over the span of six hours, she stood in a puppet-like state at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. There was a sign giving her audience the instructions that the seventy-two items on the table were to be used on her "as desired," her artist's statement being, "I am the object. During this time I take full responsibility." Some of the items included lipstick, perfume, a rose, a polaroid camera, scissors, a box of razor blades, and a gun with a single bullet. "I wanted to know, what is the public about?" The objects on the table, things intended for both pain and pleasure, were used innocently at first. Eventually, things escalated to the point where the gun was being pointed at her. At the end of her performance, she stood up and began to approach the audience, at which time they "literally ran away".

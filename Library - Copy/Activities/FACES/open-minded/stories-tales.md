**The Questioning Child**

Mommy, the moon is a stone of some sort? Yes, and it's big and it's white
But it is far away and that's why it's as small as a kite Mommy, the babies all come from the tummy?
Of course
And you'll have one? Perhaps
I don't have a big tummy You don't
You are young so you can't
And the baby inside is like a cocoon?
It's hard to explain, when you'll grow up you'll understand.
And only myself and the answers in me Are aware of the secret we know
That when you grow up You don't understand But one day
You just let the questions go.

**The Crazy Ones**

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

**Peter Pan's Adventure**

Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremor ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, "To die will be an awfully big adventure."

## Dreamer

**The Butterfly Dream**

The great Taoist master Chuang Tzu once dreamt that he was a butterfly fluttering here and there. In the dream he had no awareness of his individuality as a person. He was only a butterfly. Suddenly, he awoke and found himself laying there, a person once again. But then he thought to himself, "Was I before a man who dreamt about being a butterfly, or am I now a butterfly who dreams about being a man?"

**The Old Man and the Waterfall**

An old man slipped on a wet rock near the edge of a river and fell in. As onlookers watched in horror, he was swept towards a high waterfall.

There was great joy when he emerged bruised but otherwise unharmed downstream. "How did you manage to survive?" asked one man in the crowd that gathered around.

Said the old man, "Instead of trying to make the water accommodate me, I accommodated myself to it. Instead of fighting it, I relaxed into the swirl and allowed it to shape me. I worked with the force of the water instead of against it. That is how I survived."

## Intuitive

**The Two Systems of Thinking**

In his book, Kahneman describes the human thinking as a collaboration between two completely different technologies. Kahneman calls the first type of technology "System 1". This system operates "back stage", unaware, automatic, and the usage of it does not require any effort and is usually not created out of conscious choice. System 1 is also exclusively in charge of what we call intuition. It is, in fact, intuition.

Kahneman calls the second system "System 2". This system is the stream of conscious thinking. It is very slow and can only do one thing at a time – and even this requires some effort and control. The two systems operate in completely different manners from one another. In System 1, many associative ideas can pop up parallelly, and can go through processing and send a concrete "bottom line" to System 2. In System 2 the conclusion will enter a line of linear thoughts and ideas that follow each other in a straight line, in a rhythm not much faster than the rhythm of speaking. If the mind was a show, says Kahneman, System 2 would have been the vain side character, mistakenly thinking it is the main lead.

**The Devil and the Truth**

Krishnamurti tells the story of how the devil and a friend of his were walking down the street, when they saw ahead of them a man stoop down and pick up something from the ground, look at it, and put it away in his pocket. The friend said to the devil, "What did that man pick up?" "He picked up a piece of Truth," said the devil. "That is a very bad business for you, then," said his friend. "Oh, not at all," the devil replied, "I am going to convince him to create a method out of his findings."

## Authentic

**The Authentic Life**

I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I've become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me. I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. I decided not to coexist anymore with pretense, hypocrisy, dishonesty and cheap praise. I do not tolerate selective erudition nor academic arrogance. I do not adjust either to popular gossiping. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that's why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience.

**J.K. Rowling's Journey**

This woman needs no introduction. Her books have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide. But there was a time in her life when she was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide. Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child. She signed up for government aid (she was so poor, she could not afford to support herself and her daughter), describing her economic status as being "poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless." In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry "came fully formed" into her mind. In 1995, she finished the manuscript of her first book on an old manual typewriter. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript. Editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury advised her to get a day job since she had little chance of making money from writing children's books.

Today, she is United Kingdom's best-selling living author, with an estimated fortune of £560 million, ranking her as the twelfth richest woman in the UK. She is none other than J.K Rowling – the creator of the Harry Potter series.

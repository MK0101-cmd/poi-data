# Observational Processes - FACES Process Maps

## Overview

The map included in FACES offers 4 observational processes for personal and 1:1 work. These processes are designed to facilitate deep reflection and insight through the observation of human faces and characteristics.

## Process Map Structure

The process map is double-sided and can be twisted and turned to access different processes:

### Side A: "The Child In Me"
**Focus**: Understanding your core character and identity
**Question**: "What makes me who I am?"
**Purpose**: Explore the fundamental aspects of your personality and character

### Side B: "Back to Reality" / "Nobody's Perfect"
**Focus**: Understanding relationships with significant others
**Question**: "How do I relate to significant others?"
**Purpose**: Explore relationship patterns and dynamics

## The Four Observational Processes

### 1. Self-Character Exploration
**Purpose**: Deep dive into understanding your own character
**Process**:
- Select 3 Photo cards that represent different aspects of yourself
- Choose 3 Reflection cards that resonate with your current state
- Place cards in designated spots on the map
- Answer guiding questions about each card
- Explore connections between the cards
- Use the mirror card for final reflection

### 2. Relationship Pattern Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand how you relate to others
**Process**:
- Select Photo cards that represent significant people in your life
- Choose Reflection cards that describe your relationship dynamics
- Explore patterns in how you connect with others
- Identify recurring themes in your relationships
- Use insights to improve relationship skills

### 3. Shadow Work Integration
**Purpose**: Explore hidden or denied aspects of yourself
**Process**:
- Select Photo cards that represent parts of yourself you don't usually show
- Choose Reflection cards from challenging series (Takers, Lost, Stormy)
- Face and integrate shadow aspects
- Develop self-compassion and acceptance
- Use the mirror card to see yourself more completely

### 4. Future Self Visioning
**Purpose**: Connect with your potential and aspirations
**Process**:
- Select Photo cards that represent who you want to become
- Choose Reflection cards from positive series (Open-minded, Givers, Knowing)
- Visualize your ideal future self
- Identify steps toward becoming that person
- Use the mirror card to see your potential

## Working with the Process Maps

### Card Selection Methods

#### Exposed Cards (Face Up)
- **Advantages**: Conscious, intentional selection
- **Best for**: Specific exploration goals
- **Process**: Deliberately choose cards that resonate with your current focus

#### Hidden Cards (Face Down)
- **Advantages**: Unconscious, intuitive selection
- **Best for**: Surprising insights and breakthrough moments
- **Process**: Randomly select cards and discover what emerges

### Guiding Questions for Each Process

#### For Self-Character Exploration:
- What does this face tell me about myself?
- How do I see myself in this character?
- What aspects of this person do I recognize in me?
- What would I like to learn from this character?

#### For Relationship Pattern Analysis:
- How do I relate to people like this?
- What patterns do I see in my relationships?
- What attracts me to or repels me from this type of person?
- How can I improve my relationships?

#### For Shadow Work Integration:
- What do I not want to see in myself?
- How do I judge or reject this aspect?
- What would happen if I accepted this part of me?
- How can I integrate this shadow aspect?

#### For Future Self Visioning:
- Who do I want to become?
- What qualities do I want to develop?
- How can I embody this character's strengths?
- What steps can I take toward this vision?

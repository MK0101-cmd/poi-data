# FACES Building Blocks

This directory contains the 7 core reflection series from the FACES game, each designed to facilitate deep self-reflection, relationship exploration, and personal growth through the observation of human faces and characteristics.

## Building Blocks Overview

### 1. [Open-minded Series](open-minded/README.md)
The places where we are open for opportunities. Creative and curious parts that know how to let go, dream, feel comfortable even when out of the comfort zone, get emotional, and believe everything will be okay.

### 2. [Givers Series](givers/README.md)
The places where we open our hearts. Warm and sensitive parts that notice others, give way easily to help out, differentiate, take in, give precise care with generosity, and are completely devoted.

### 3. [Takers Series](takers/README.md)
The places where we are mean to ourselves and to others. Parts that awaken feelings of shame, insecurity, doubt and fear, leaving us with less energy, confidence, joy, and peacefulness.

### 4. [Stormy Series](stormy/README.md)
The places where we let ourselves go wild. Parts where fire burns and there's no other way than to feel intensely. These parts are loyal to inner truth and the power pushing from inside.

### 5. [Calculated Series](calculated/README.md)
The places where we are accurate with ourselves. Parts that love order and logic, providing analytical ability, coolness and stability under pressure, while keeping morals and ethics.

### 6. [Lost Series](lost/README.md)
The places where we lose our way. Stuck parts in dark places we don't know how to get out of. Vulnerable, victim-like, voiceless parts that cause us to lose faith and give up.

### 7. [Knowing Series](knowing/README.md)
The places where we know deep inside. Parts that just know - connected, independent, on their path. These parts make us turn into leaders and deal with the quest and journey.

## How to Use These Building Blocks

Each building block contains:
- **Stories/Tales**: Engaging narratives that illustrate the concept
- **Key Quotes**: Inspirational and thought-provoking quotes
- **Reflection Questions**: Deep questions for personal exploration
- **Common Responses**: Examples of typical reactions and mindsets
- **Training Applications**: Specific ways to use the content in training

### Implementation Tips

1. **Choose Relevant Blocks**: Select reflection series that align with your exploration objectives
2. **Create Safe Space**: Ensure participants feel comfortable sharing personal reflections
3. **Use Stories as Entry Points**: Begin with the stories to create engagement
4. **Encourage Deep Reflection**: Use the reflection questions to facilitate meaningful dialogue
5. **Address Resistance**: Use the common responses to help participants recognize their patterns
6. **Apply Practically**: Connect insights to real-world applications and relationships

## Integration with BTC24 Framework

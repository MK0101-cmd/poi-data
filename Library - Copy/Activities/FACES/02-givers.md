## Reflections in this Series

### Generous
/ GIVING / ACCEPTING / BENEVOLENT /

**Story:**
A woman was waiting at an airport one night. She hunted for a book in the airport shops, bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop. She was engrossed in her book but happened to see, that the man sitting beside her, as bold as could be… grabbed a cookie or two from the bag in between, which she tried to ignore to avoid a scene. She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by, thinking, "If I wasn't so nice, I would blacken his eye." With each cookie she took, he took one too, when only one was left, she wondered what he would do. With a smile on his face, he took the last cookie and broke it in half. He offered her half, as he ate the other, she snatched it from him and thought… oooh, brother. This guy has some nerve and he's also rude, why he didn't even show any gratitude! She had never known when she had been so galled, and sighed with relief when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate. She boarded the plane, and sank in her seat, then she sought her book, which was almost complete. As she reached in her baggage, she gasped with surprise, there was her bag of cookies, in front of her eyes. If mine are here, she moaned in despair, the others were his, and he tried to share. Too late to apologize, she realized with grief, that she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief.

**Story:**
Spiritual leader, humanitarian and visionary Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, known throughout the world simply as "Amma," has served the world-community for decades, imparting wisdom, strength and inspiration. Through her extraordinary acts of love, inner strength and self-sacrifice, Amma has endeared herself to millions and inspired thousands to follow in her path of selfless service.

Mata Amritanandamayi concludes her programs by embracing each person attending the event. Far from a brief book-signing or walk along the rope line, these personal, one-on-one meetings take up the vast majority of Amma's time. Amma has given this motherly embrace, known as her darshan, to more than 38 million people throughout the world. She has been known to give darshan for more than 22 hours without interruption.

### Gentle
/ GRACEFUL / SOFT / INTROVERT / SHY /

**Story:**
In 1851, German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer formulated what has been termed the "hedgehog's dilemma," a parable about human relationships and intimacy. The parable goes something like this: when it is cold outside, hedgehogs move towards one another in order to be warmed by each other's body heat. However, upon reaching a certain closeness to one another they are pricked by each other's prickly spines, causing them to retreat to a safer distance. The hedgehogs must find the proper distance from one another to remain warm and not get hurt.

### Teacher
/ GUIDE / COACH / MASTER /

**Story:**
Gurdjeiff, and other great spiritual teachers, like Krisnamurti, are those "messengers from above," that based on their feelings came to the world to fix it, and specifically in the generations where corruption feasts. None of these messengers succeeded in bringing their intended correction, and it cannot be any other way. Because no one can bring the correction to others, and the attempt of the teacher to fix only distances the people from their own ability to fix themselves.

Krishnamurti once said that 700 years shall go by before another man like himself shows up. But he also said that there are no real spiritual teachers and gurus, because all spiritual teachers only strengthen the separateness and conflict and the corruption in the world, and that eventually every man needs to be his own light.

### Devoted
/ LOYAL / SAFE HAVEN / SURRENDER / FRIEND /

**Story:**
I am a doctor working at a little clinic. One day an old man in his 80's walked into my clinic.

He told me he was in a rush, as he had a very important engagement at 9 AM he couldn't miss. I decided to treat him since the doctor in charge was busy.

While I was gently pulling out his stitches, I asked him where he was off to that was more important than this treatment.

"I am going to have breakfast with my wife, who is in the hospital." "Why was she hospitalized, if I may ask?"

"She's been there for a few years now," he answered. "she has Alzheimer's and needs constant care."

I asked the man if his wife would be worried if he were late to their breakfast.

"No," he said quietly, "She hasn't recognized me in over five years." "And you go to her every morning although she doesn't know who you are?"

The man smiled and said: "She may not know who I am, but I know who she is, and I remember for both of us." And he shook my hand, thanked me and left me standing there, my body shaking with sudden emotion.

**Story:**
We love women. We want women. But that's all we know. That's why we honk from our cars. Yell out from construction areas.

These are our best ideas so far. Honk from cars… It amazes me! It's got to be the last active brain cell in the guy's mind thinking about it. She's walking down the street, he's in the car. beep-beep "I think I made myself clear…" What exactly is she to do? Kick her heels and start running after the car? Hang on to the bumper? The car stops. And she says: "It's a good thing you honked. I had no idea how you're feeling."

/ POSITIVE / HAPPY / CELEBRATING /

**Story:**
A traveler walking alone saw a monk working in a field, so he stopped and asked him: "I'm on my way to the village in the valley, can you tell me what it's like?" "Where have you come from?" enquired the monk. "I have come from the village in the mountains. It was terrible!" the man exclaimed, "no-one spoke my language, I had to sleep on a dirt floor, they fed me disgusting stew and the weather was atrocious." "Then I think that you will find that the village in the valley is much the same," the monk noted. A few hours later another traveler passed by and he said to the monk, "I am on my way to the village in the valley, can you tell what it's like?" "Where have you come from?" enquired the monk. "I have come from the village in the mountains - it was awesome!" the man replied, "No-one spoke my language so we had to communicate using our hands! I had to sleep on the dirt floor - I've never done that before! They fed me some sort of weird stew and it was so cool to experience how the locals lived! The weather was freezing cold, which meant that I really got a taste of the local conditions. It was one of the best experiences of my life." "Then I think that you'll find that the village in the valley is much the same," responded the monk.

### Humble
/ MODEST / UNASSUMING / QUIET /

**Story:**
These are the few ways we can practice humility: To speak as little as possible of one's self. To mind one's own business. Not to want to manage other people's affairs. To avoid curiosity. To accept contradictions and correction cheerfully. To pass over the mistakes of others. To accept insults and injuries. To accept being slighted, forgotten and disliked. To be kind and gentle even under provocation. Never to stand on one's dignity. To choose always the hardest.

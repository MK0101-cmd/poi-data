# Working 1:1 - FACES Process

## Overview

The process map is designed for personal work or for 1:1 work. The map enables connecting several cards to guiding questions which lead a thought process.

The map is double sided and you can twist it and turn it around in order to go from process to process:

## Side A: "The Child In Me"
**Question**: "What makes me who I am?"

2 Maps to examine one character.

## Side B: "Back to reality" "Nobody's Perfect"
**Question**: "How do I relate to significant others?"

2 Maps to examine relationships with significant others.

## Process Steps

### 1. Choose Your Focus
Choose the map which suits your interest best. Read the questions and focus on the relevant character or relationship.

### 2. Select Cards
Choose 3 Photo cards and 3 Reflection cards (facing up/down - your choice.) Place the cards in the marked spots on the map.

### 3. Explore Each Question
Go over each question separately and observe the cards you chose:
- What does each card express?
- How do the cards connect to each other?
- How do the cards answer the question?

### 4. Deepen with the Book
Open the book at the page numbers that are written on your chosen Reflection cards. During the process of going over the information in the book, try to look at the question from different points of view.

### 4a. Photo Card Content Integration
- **Card Identification**: Use [PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md](../PHOTO-CARDS-INDEX.md) to identify which series each of your 3 Photo Cards belongs to
- **Series Exploration**: For each Photo Card, explore the corresponding building block content
- **Cross-Series Connections**: Notice how your 3 Photo Cards might represent different aspects of the same theme
- **Content Deepening**: Use the specific story, quote, and question links from the Photo Card index to deepen your exploration

### 4b. Reflection Card Integration
- **Reflection Card Identification**: Use [REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md](../REFLECTION-CARDS-INDEX.md) to identify which series each of your 3 Reflection Cards belongs to
- **Page Number Navigation**: Use the page numbers on your Reflection Cards to access specific building block content
- **Thematic Connections**: Notice how your Reflection Card themes connect with your Photo Card emotions
- **Combined Exploration**: Use Photo + Reflection Card combinations for comprehensive exploration

### 5. Mirror Reflection
At the end of the process, take the mirror card in your hands, look into your own eyes and ask yourself:
**What is the most meaningful insight I am taking with me from this process?**

## Working with Cards

### Exposed Cards (Face Up)
- Enables a fascinating process of choosing
- Allows for conscious selection based on what resonates
- Creates intentional exploration of specific themes

### Hidden Cards (Face Down)
- Enables letting go and adds an element of surprise

Both ways create interesting dynamics and eventually achieve the same goals.

# In Between Series - Building Blocks

The moments when life actually happens.

This series represents when we are between action and action. It's these delicate moments that we want to capture. We live not in the doing but in the in between. To be open to the unknown. The integration is in us, between one moment and the next. Being gentle and enjoying the path not the outcome.

## Story: Green Eggs and Ham

Theodore Geisel, best known as Dr. Seuss, wrote The Cat in the Hat after an editor challenged him to write a book that would use 250 of the 400 words that beginning readers should know. Well, the good doctor came very close, using 220. Later, the publisher Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write a book using only fifty words. He could!

You know the children's favorite that resulted as Green Eggs and Ham.

Would you like them Here or there?

I would not like them here or there.

I would not like them anywhere.

I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-am

*Dr. Seuss, Green Eggs And Ham*

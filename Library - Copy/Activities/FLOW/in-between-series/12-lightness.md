## Story: The Boy and the Branch

There were two little boys playing on a frozen lake and despite the warning signs of thin ice, one boy fell through and was trapped and couldn't get out.

His friend was trying to save him, but he couldn't. He could see him through the thin ice, but he couldn't help him... So he ran to the nearest tree, climbed it, and broke off an enormous branch. Then, he ran back to his friend and started breaking the ice with the branch and finally managed to pull him out of the water.

When the paramedics came, they were baffled as to how this young little boy could rip off such an enormous branch, and THEN break the ice with it to help his friend. They just couldn't see how it was possible.

Then an elderly man who was there said: I know how he did it. They asked him how.

The man said: "There was no one here to tell him he couldn't do it."

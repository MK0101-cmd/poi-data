## Story: Dancing in the Rain

The promise of sunlight. But there is only rain. The promise of warmth. But there is only coldness. The promise of laughter. But there is only silence. Rain pours, storms roar, Rivers run wild, Sandals stay in and raincoats come out.

This is July, and the inevitable summer washout days are here. The ones with the power to dampen even the brightest of spirits. But we can fight the feelings it forces us to feel.

We can make the most out of the rainy days and wait for the flurry of wildflowers.

And while we wait, Dancing in the rain is never a bad idea.

# FLOW Facilitator's Guide

## Overview

This guide is designed for facilitators, coaches, therapists, and group leaders who want to use FLOW effectively with individuals and groups. It provides comprehensive guidance for creating meaningful experiences and supporting others through their FLOW journey.

## Understanding FLOW as a Tool

### **Core Philosophy**
- FLOW is a visual metaphor tool, not a diagnostic instrument
- There are no right or wrong answers or interpretations
- The power lies in the participant's own insights and connections
- The facilitator's role is to guide, not to interpret or analyze

### **Key Principles**
- **Non-judgmental**: Accept all responses as valid
- **Curious**: Ask open-ended questions to deepen exploration
- **Present**: Be fully attentive to the participant's process
- **Supportive**: Create a safe space for vulnerability and discovery

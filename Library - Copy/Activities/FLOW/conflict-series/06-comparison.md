## Story: The Samurai and the Moon

A noble and honest Samurai went to visit a Zen monk to ask him for his advice. When he reached the monk the Samurai asked, "Why do I feel so inferior? I have faced death many times, defended those who are weak. Nevertheless, upon seeing you meditating, I felt that my life had absolutely no importance whatsoever."

"Wait. Once I have attended to all those who come to see me today, I shall answer you." replied the monk

The samurai spent the whole day, watching the people go in and out in search of advice. He saw how the monk received them all. At nightfall, when everyone had gone, he demanded: "Now can you teach me?" The master led him to his room. The full moon shone in the sky, and the atmosphere was one of profound tranquility.

"Do you see the moon, how beautiful it is? It will cross the sky, and tomorrow the sun will shine once again. But sunlight is much brighter, and can show the details of the landscape around us: trees, mountains, clouds. I never heard the moon say: 'why do I not shine like the sun? Is it because I am inferior?'"

"Of course not," answered the samurai. "The moon and the sun are different things, each has its own beauty. You cannot compare the two."

"So you know the answer. "We are two different people, each fighting in his own way for that which he believes, and making the world a better place; the rest are mere appearances."

## Key Quotes

> "When you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter. As you see him you will see yourself. As you treat him you will treat yourself. As you think of him you will think of yourself."

> **A Course in Miracles**

> "This physical world has no two things alike. Every comparison is awkwardly rough. You can put a lion next to a man, but the placing is hazardous to both."

> **Rumi**

> "Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing."

> **Thich Nhat Hanh**

> "Comparing penis sizes is a much more nuanced and sophisticated way to determine who's right than something as clunky and uncouth as a debate."

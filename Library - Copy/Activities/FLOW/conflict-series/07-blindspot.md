## Story: The Zen Teacher's Awareness

After ten years of study, a monk attained the rank of Zen Teacher. One rainy day soon after his advancement, he journeyed to visit his old Zen Master.

When he walked into the house, the Master greeted him with a question.

"Tell me, did you leave your sandals and umbrella on the porch?" "Yes," replied the Teacher.

"And tell me," the Master continued, "Did you leave your umbrella to the left or to the right of your sandals?"

The Teacher realized he did not know the answer, and that he had not yet attained full awareness. He stayed and studied with the Master for ten more years.

## Story: The Wise Man's Suitcase

Once upon a time there lived a man who was wise, well known and very rich. One day the man's wife died. His children came to him and said that it was a shame to live alone in such a big house. Sell the house and your fields, give us the money, and you can live with your oldest son, and we will take care of all your needs. The man agreed, sold everything he had, divided up all his wealth among his children, and went to live in the home of his oldest son. Gradually the children and grandchildren stopped coming to visit, and in his oldest son's house they turned against him. One day, the man said to his oldest son, call the mayor and gather all your brothers and sisters, I have something important to give you. When everyone was assembled, the man said to them: look, I have one large suitcase full of money, gold and diamonds. The suitcase is buried under the big tree at the entrance to our town, and it is locked with two padlocks. Only the two keys together can open the suitcase. Here is one key that I'm giving to you, Mr. Mayor, and I give the other key to you, my oldest son. From that day on, the man's situation improved incomparably and he returned to his former state. One day, he died, and all his sons and daughters went with the mayor to the tree at the entrance to town. They dug and dug until they found the large suitcase. When they opened the suitcase, they found a head of a donkey and a letter. The letter, in the man's handwriting, read: "Only a donkey gives away everything he has in his lifetime".

# Flow

## Story

Once upon a time there was a Shogun who wanted a nice picture of a chicken to go in his tokonoma. So, he went to a very fine artist and said, "I want you to paint me the best picture of a chicken that you can."

So, the artist said, "Yes, yes, certainly, I will do this."

The artist went to his cabin high on Mount Fuji. He brought books of bird anatomy, many studies of birds done by all the famous artists of the past, he sculpted chickens, he painted chickens in oil, he did one woodblock after another of nothing but chickens.

Ten years passed.

One day the Shogun was at archery practice when he thought of his request to the artist. He immediately mounted his steed and made his way to the artist's cabin. It was hard to enter the door. There were sketches of chickens stacked to the ceiling. There were statues of chickens everywhere. There were skeletons of chickens and paintings of chickens. There was nowhere to sit and very little space to stand.

"Where is my chicken drawing?" demanded the Shogun.

"Oh," said the artist, "I forgot, sorry." And he took a brush, whirled it very quickly on a piece of rice paper, handed the paper to the Shogun, and said, "Here."

## Quotes

Forget yourself. Become one with the universe and your music. Let it flow through you. No matter how perfect technically, if your expression is not natural and unselfconscious, your music won't affect others emotionally but will merely be your subjective counterfeit.

Basho

One of my teachers once said that the way you know you're on the right path is that it works.

James Redfield

Allowing the truth of who you are, your spiritual self, to rule your life means you stop the struggle and learn to move with the flow of your life.

Oprah Winfrey

It is when we act freely, for the sake of the action itself rather than for ulterior motives, that we learn to become more than what we were.

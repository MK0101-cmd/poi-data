## Story: The E-mail Mix-up

A man left the snowy streets of Chicago to enjoy a vacation in sunny Florida. His wife, who was on a business trip, planned to join him and meet up with him in Miami the following day. The man arrived at the hotel after spending the whole day lying on the beach, under the coconut palms, drinking tropical cocktails...

He decided to send an e-mail to his wife telling her about the wonders of the place. However, as fate would have it, he got one letter in the address wrong and his e-mail message ended up in the mailbox of the wife of a Protestant minister who had died the previous day. That night, the minister's wife opened her e-mail to read the condolence messages. When she saw the message she gave a cry, tried to get up, but collapsed and died of a heart attack. Her relatives, hearing her cry out, rushed to her room and when they saw that she was dead, they read the message:

"My dear wife, I have just arrived. The journey was long, but it was worthwhile. Everything is wonderful - truly paradise! The trees, the gardens, the parties. Although I have only been here a few hours, I already feel at home. Now I am going to rest a while. I just wanted to tell you that I have already talked to people here, and everyone is waiting for you to arrive. I am certain that you will like the place. Prepare yourself; it is hot as hell here! Sincerely, your eternally loving husband."

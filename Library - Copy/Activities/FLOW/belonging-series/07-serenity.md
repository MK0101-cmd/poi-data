## Story: The Teenager's Question

A little while ago my sixteen-year-old niece sent me a long email. The gist of it was, "Life sucks. I see my dad coming home from work every day totally bummed out. I don't want to get trapped in the rat race, but I don't see any hope of avoiding it. Is this what life is about? What's the point? I might as well just shoot myself and die."

"Christina," I wrote back, "you might not think this is a great response but I'm proud of you. I can't tell you that you are going to solve your dilemma and find The Answer. I know you want answers- but sometimes life doesn't provide them right away. But you are asking the right questions, and that is important."

---

## Block 3: What Are We Gaining?
- **Marketing**: Access to new customers; more accessible (work, geography, disability).  
- **Going deeper**: Digesting between sessions brings depth.  
- **Pause**: More practice of Pause together.  
- **Stronger glue for the group**: Repetition builds connection.  
- **Platform**: Enables delivery of content.  

---

## Block 4: What Are We Losing? (Part 1)
- **Generic Setting**: Same environment for work, workshops, family → less differentiation.  
- **Participant Setting**: Cannot control participants’ environments.  
- **Self-consciousness**: Constant awareness of self-image and movements; loss of authenticity.  
- **Existential anxiety**: Am I seen? Am I heard?  

---

## Block 5: What Are We Losing? (Part 2)
- **3D to 2D**: All appear the same; loss of depth.  
- **Non-verbal communication**: ~80% lost (no body, smell, eye contact).  
- **Sound**: Flattened, single channel; no parallel voices.  
- **Loss of spontaneity of life**: Only controlled reactions remain.  

---

## Block 6: What Are We Losing? (Part 3)
- **Uncomfortable silences**: Technical issues, fatigue, delays.  
- **Zoom fatigue**: More focus required; logistic burdens.  
- **Holding the Space**: Facilitators left behind while participants in breakout rooms → loss of shared space.  

---

## Block 7: What Are We Losing? (Part 4)
- **Spontaneity of communication**: Muted, controlled interactions.  
- **Break-time interactions**: Participants vanish during breaks.  
- **Transference**: Reduced therapeutic element of natural presence.  
- **POY experience**: Zoom is good for content delivery, but POY emphasizes shared experience.

## Block 8: What Should We Pay Attention To? (Part 1)
- **Tune In**: Longer tuning process (3–4 days).  
  - Positive: Participants process between sessions.  
  - Negative: Need to bring participants back daily.  
- **In My House**: Participants invite us into their intimate spaces.  
  - Positive: Builds intimacy.  
  - Negative: Overexposure and lack of safe space.

## Block 9: What Should We Pay Attention To? (Part 2)
- **Breakout Rooms**:  
  - Positive: Creates closeness in small groups.  
  - Negative: Facilitator loses visibility into reactions and dynamics.  
- **Random pairing**:  
  - Positive: Unexpected, like choosing a card face down.  
  - Negative: Lack of control may trigger resistance.  
- **Zoom in/out**: Navigating closeness and distance within the platform.

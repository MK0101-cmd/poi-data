## What Are We Losing?

### Environmental Challenges
- **Generic Setting**: Same environment for work, workshops, family
- **Participant Setting**: Cannot control participants' environments
- **Self-Consciousness**: Constant awareness of self-image and movements
- **Existential Anxiety**: Am I seen? Am I heard?

### Communication Limitations
- **3D to 2D**: All appear the same; loss of depth
- **Non-verbal Communication**: ~80% lost (no body, smell, eye contact)
- **Sound**: Flattened, single channel; no parallel voices
- **Loss of Spontaneity**: Only controlled reactions remain

### Technical Challenges
- **Uncomfortable Silences**: Technical issues, fatigue, delays
- **Zoom Fatigue**: More focus required; logistic burdens
- **Holding the Space**: Facilitators left behind while participants in breakout rooms
- **Spontaneity Loss**: Muted, controlled interactions

### Experience Limitations
- **Break-time Interactions**: Participants vanish during breaks
- **Transference**: Reduced therapeutic element of natural presence
- **POY Experience**: Zoom is good for content delivery, but POY emphasizes shared experience

# Spring Clean â€“ Building Blocks

## Objective
As the seasons change, it is a natural time to pause and reflect.  
This process helps you clarify what you want to focus on in the upcoming cycle.

## Pause
Take a moment to breathe deeply and close your eyes.  
Notice where you are with yourself.  
When ready, open your eyes and begin the new season with clarity and focus.

## File Relationships

```
01_Theory_Foundation.md (foundation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_Technique_Mapping.md (applications)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_AI_Facilitation_Framework.md (implementation)

## Key Principles

1. **Multiperspectivity**: There is no single truth, only multiple points of view
2. **Projective Nature**: Images serve as mirrors for internal states
3. **Co-created Meaning**: Understanding emerges through collaborative dialogue
4. **Respectful Curiosity**: Questions open rather than close possibilities
5. **Safety First**: Always honor user boundaries and comfort levels

## The Tool Structure and Process

### 1. Ask Questions
Continuously ask questions to draw participants into the discussion and encourage them to take ownership of their contributions.

**Types of Questions:**
- **Open-ended:** "How do you feel about...?"
- **Reflective:** "What does this mean to you?"
- **Exploratory:** "What if we tried...?"
- **Connecting:** "How does this relate to...?"

### 2. Prioritize Participant Voices
Ensure that participants' statements take precedence over the facilitator's, as this increases the impact and retention of the content.

**Strategies:**
- **Listen First:** Let participants speak before responding
- **Build on Their Ideas:** Use their contributions as a foundation
- **Acknowledge Contributions:** Recognize and validate their input
- **Connect Ideas:** Help them see connections between their ideas

- **Encourage Risk-taking:** Support participants in sharing new ideas
- **Validate Contributions:** Acknowledge the value of their input
- **Facilitate Connections:** Help them see how their ideas connect

"We've discussed the importance of collaboration, but I'd love to hear from you – how do you think we can apply this concept in our current project?"

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "What specific challenges do you see?"

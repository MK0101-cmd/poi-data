# Chapter 5: Training Building Blocks

## Overview

This chapter breaks down the training process into essential building blocks to help you, as trainers, customize your sessions to meet the needs of your clients and participants. These building blocks are fundamental elements that should be included in all of your Points of You® training, and we recommend them for any training you conduct.

By focusing on these core components, you can ensure that each session is structured, meaningful, and impactful. These building blocks guide you in creating a welcoming atmosphere from the beginning, reducing participant resistance, and boosting their excitement.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Visual Analysis

#### Initial Observation
1. **Look at the image carefully**: Take time to observe all elements
2. **Identify key visual elements**: Note objects, people, colors, composition
3. **Observe emotional tone**: What mood or atmosphere does it create?
4. **Note any text or captions**: Include textual elements in analysis
5. **Consider the setting**: What environment or context is shown?

#### Symbolic Interpretation
1. **Extract symbolic meanings**: What do visual elements represent?
2. **Identify metaphors**: What larger concepts does the image suggest?
3. **Consider universal themes**: How does this connect to human experience?
4. **Note contradictions or tensions**: What paradoxes or conflicts are present?
5. **Think about transformation**: What change or journey does this suggest?

2. **Logical flow**: Do themes build on each other meaningfully?
3. **Complete components**: Are all required elements present and complete?
4. **Balanced depth**: Is this appropriately deep for the intended context?
5. **Therapeutic progression**: Does this support deeper self-understanding?

### Step 6: Testing and Refinement

#### Test with Sample Users
1. **Select test participants**: Choose representative users for your context
2. **Conduct test sessions**: Run through the analysis with test users
3. **Gather feedback**: Collect input on clarity, relevance, and effectiveness

# Personal Therapy Reflection Template

## Overview
This template provides the standard format for creating personal therapy reflections using photo cards. It ensures consistency, therapeutic value, and personal relevance across all reflection exercises.

## Standard Format Structure

### Template Pattern
```
1. **[Theme Name]**: The [visual element] can symbolize [concept]. Reflect on [personal aspect]. [Specific question about personal life]?
```

### Component Breakdown
- **Theme Name**: Universal theme (e.g., "Balance and Stability")
- **Visual Element**: Specific object or element in the image
- **Symbolic Meaning**: What the element represents metaphorically
- **Reflective Prompt**: Personal connection invitation
- **Specific Question**: Open-ended inquiry for deeper exploration

## Example Applications

### Example 1: Bicycle Against Tree
```
1. **Balance and Stability**: The bicycle leaning against the tree can symbolize a need for support and stability. Reflect on the sources of support in your life that help you maintain balance. What or who do you lean on when you need stability?
```

### Example 2: Child on Swing "Alone"
```
1. **Solitude vs. Loneliness**: The child swinging alone can symbolize the difference between being alone and feeling lonely. Reflect on how you perceive solitude. Is it a time for personal reflection and joy, or does it evoke feelings of isolation?
```

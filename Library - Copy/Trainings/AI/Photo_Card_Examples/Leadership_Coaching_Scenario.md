## Scenario Overview
**Context**: Executive coaching session with a senior manager struggling with team dynamics
**Participant**: Sarah, VP of Marketing, 15 years experience
**Challenge**: Team conflict affecting performance and morale
**Session Goal**: Develop leadership skills for managing difficult team dynamics

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: Opening & Energy Setting (15 minutes)

#### Opening Prompts
**Facilitator**: "Let's take a moment to pause. Take three deep breaths. What do you notice in your body, in your mind? What word or image comes to you right now?"

**Sarah's Response**: "I feel tense, especially in my shoulders. I'm thinking about the team meeting yesterday that went badly. I see an image of a storm cloud."

**Facilitator**: "If your current emotional state was a photo card, what would it look like? Would it be stormy, sunny, foggy, still?"

**Sarah's Response**: "Definitely stormy. Dark clouds, maybe some lightning. I feel like I'm in the middle of a storm I can't control."

**Facilitator**: "What would you like to focus on today? What's one word that would help guide our conversation?"

**Sarah's Response**: "I want to understand how to lead through this storm. The word that comes to me is 'calm' - I need to find calm in the chaos."

### Phase 2: Exploration & Discovery (45 minutes)

#### Visual Analysis - Team Dynamics
**Facilitator**: "Let's look at this photo card of a stormy sea with a lighthouse. What stands out to you in this image? What draws your attention?"

**Sarah's Response**: "The lighthouse stands out - it's steady and strong despite the storm. The waves are chaotic and unpredictable. I feel like I'm the lighthouse, trying to provide stability, but the storm is overwhelming."

**Facilitator**: "If this image could speak, what would it say? And what would it *not* say?"

**Sarah's Response**: "It would say 'I'm here, I'm steady, you can trust me.' It wouldn't say 'I'm scared' or 'I don't know what to do.' But that's how I feel inside."

#### Perspective Shifting - Team Member Viewpoints
**Facilitator**: "Let's use this Faces card. Who is this person in your story? What is their relationship to your current situation?"

**Sarah's Response**: "This looks like my team member, Mike. He's been the most vocal about the conflicts. I think he's frustrated and feels unheard."

**Facilitator**: "If Mike could talk, what would he want you to know? What are you afraid to say to him?"

**Sarah's Response**: "He'd want me to know that he feels I'm not listening to his concerns. I'm afraid to tell him that I feel overwhelmed and don't know how to fix everything."

#### Reframing Leadership Challenge
**Facilitator**: "Imagine this team conflict was a scene on a card. What does it look like? Now, choose a word that could represent a new lens or value to bring to this challenge."

**Sarah's Response**: "It looks like a tangled web - everyone connected but in a messy, complicated way. The word that comes to me is 'patience' - maybe I need to be more patient with the process."

**Facilitator**: "How might patience change how you approach this situation?"

**Sarah's Response**: "Instead of trying to fix everything quickly, I could take time to really understand each person's perspective. Maybe the conflict isn't something to solve but something to understand."

#### Story Building - Leadership Journey
**Facilitator**: "Let's create a story with these three cards: the stormy sea, the lighthouse, and this tangled web. Which one is the beginning, the turning point, the ending? Which one represents *you*?"

**Sarah's Response**: "The stormy sea is the beginning - that's where I am now, in the chaos. The tangled web is the turning point - that's when I realize I need to understand the complexity rather than just fix it. The lighthouse is the ending - that's who I want to be, steady and guiding. I'm the lighthouse, but I'm also in the storm."

### Phase 3: Integration & Action Planning (30 minutes)

#### Action Planning
**Facilitator**: "Based on your insights today, what is one thing you'll do in the next 24 hours, one in the next week, and one in the next month?"

**Sarah's Response**: 
- "24 hours: I'll have individual conversations with each team member to really listen to their concerns."
- "Next week: I'll facilitate a team meeting where everyone can share their perspective without judgment."
- "Next month: I'll implement regular check-ins and create a team agreement about how we work together."

#### Body Awareness Integration
**Facilitator**: "Scan your body. What image does this tension remind you of? What photo card matches the sensation in your chest?"

**Sarah's Response**: "The tension in my chest feels like a tight knot. It reminds me of this card with a bird in a cage - I feel trapped by the situation. But I also feel like I have the key to let myself out."

**Facilitator**: "What would it take to open that cage?"

**Sarah's Response**: "I need to stop trying to control everything and start trusting the process. Maybe the conflict is actually a sign that people care enough to engage, not that I'm failing as a leader."

#### Visual Mantra Creation
**Facilitator**: "Choose one photo card and one word card. Together, what statement do they create? Let that be your mantra for the next 30 days."

**Sarah's Response**: "I choose the lighthouse card and the word 'patience.' My mantra is: 'I am the steady lighthouse, guiding with patience through the storm.'"

### Phase 4: Closing & Integration (15 minutes)

#### Session Integration
**Facilitator**: "What's the theme that ties our session together? If you had to name the story of this journey in one sentence, what would it be?"

**Sarah's Response**: "The theme is about finding my steady center as a leader. The story is: 'I'm learning to be the lighthouse - steady, patient, and trusting that I can guide my team through the storm.'"

#### Commitment Setting
**Facilitator**: "What's one thing you commit to doing before we meet again?"

**Sarah's Response**: "I commit to having those individual conversations with my team members, really listening without trying to fix everything immediately."

#### Gratitude Practice
**Facilitator**: "What are you grateful for about today's session?"

**Sarah's Response**: "I'm grateful for the realization that I don't have to have all the answers. I can be the steady presence that helps my team navigate the storm together."

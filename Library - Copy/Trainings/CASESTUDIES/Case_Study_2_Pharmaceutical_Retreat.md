# Case Study 2: Fostering Connection and Vision in a Global Pharmaceutical Company

## A. Introduction

### Organization Overview
A leading international pharmaceutical company, with a workforce of approximately 80,000 employees worldwide, organized a three-day retreat for 160 employees. These employees came from diverse departments, including engineering, product management, maintenance, and logistics. The retreat was part of the company's efforts to celebrate a significant milestone and strengthen internal collaboration.

### Challenge
The retreat had two primary goals:

1. **Foster Connection**: Bring together employees from different departments to build stronger relationships and encourage collaboration.

2. **Set Vision for the Future**: Provide a platform for employees to reflect on the past year's achievements and create personal vision boards for the upcoming year.

The challenge was to design an engaging and impactful experience for such a large and diverse group, ensuring active participation and meaningful outcomes.

## B. Approach

### Solution
Points of You® developed a two-part workshop that leveraged the collective energy of all 160 participants, focusing on reflection, connection, and future visioning.

### Process

1. **Designing a Large-Scale, Unified Experience**
   To maximize the power of the group, the workshop was designed to engage all participants simultaneously, rather than splitting them into smaller groups.

2. **Workshop Structure**
   - **Part 1: Reflection with The Coaching Game**
     Participants began by reflecting on the past year using **The Coaching Game**. They worked in pairs, rotating partners throughout the session. Each pair explored key questions designed to surface insights about their achievements, challenges, and learnings. This format encouraged cross-departmental interaction and fostered new connections.

   - **Part 2: Vision Setting with Clicket**
     In the second half of the workshop, participants used **Clicket**, an innovative Points of You® tool, to create personal vision boards. These boards reflected their aspirations for the upcoming year, both professionally and personally.

3. **Creating an Inspiring Environment**
   The Points of You® team meticulously prepared the venue to enhance the experience:
   - **Creative Setup**: Tables were adorned with Clicket kits, photo cards, and colorful materials
   - **Ambiance**: A curated playlist played in the background, energizing the room and inspiring creativity

4. **Sharing and Integration**
   Once participants completed their vision boards, they gathered in small groups to share their creations. This provided an opportunity to articulate their goals and receive support and encouragement from their peers.

## C. Results

### Outcomes

1. **Enhanced Connection and Collaboration**
   Employees reported forming new connections and gaining a deeper understanding of colleagues from different departments.

2. **Unleashed Creativity**
   Participants, even those from highly analytical roles, embraced the creative process, finding it both refreshing and impactful.

3. **Emotional Engagement**
   Many participants shared that the experience was deeply moving. Even those known for being reserved or skeptical opened up, leading to heartfelt discussions and personal breakthroughs.

4. **Clear Vision for the Future**
   The vision boards served as a tangible representation of participants' aspirations, helping them align their personal goals with the company's mission.

### Participant Feedback
*"This workshop was a game-changer. I connected with colleagues in ways I never thought possible, and the vision board exercise gave me clarity and motivation for the year ahead."*

### Additional Insight
Following the workshop, the company's **Head of Innovation** expressed interest in a dedicated session for her team. She highlighted how the experience revealed untapped potential within her colleagues and recognized the value of applying Points of You® tools in smaller, more focused team settings.

## D. Conclusion

### Impact
The workshop successfully achieved its goals, fostering deeper connections and equipping participants with a clear vision for the future.

### Next Steps
Building on the workshop's success, the company plans to:
- **Incorporate Points of You® tools** into other initiatives, such as team-building events and strategy sessions
